# Tree list

An index of bonsai I currently own.

## Meta

I'm *really* not sure that a .MD file is the best medium for this.  Ideally I'd have a solution that was better normalised - able to capture both tree names and interventions - and easy to upload pictures to from my phone to let me construct a timeline.  It would also make it easier to archive off trees if/when I start selling the things (or not, if the info would be useful for subsequent buyers).

However, a .MD file has the advantage that it operates easily through a Git repository (whereas most of the alternatives would require either database space or a proper web space).  So, unless and until I fire up my alexlabram.co.uk domain again, it's a fair starting point.

Note: before I can really get the most out of this, I need to start mass-producing markers of some kind that I can attach to pots.  Current plan is to get hold of some cheap white cotton (old tshirt?) and mark the bonsai ID in red (I have some red paint handy
