Blurb as used, for future reference:

> The ancient art of bonsai - growing trees in miniature - can be frustrating for first-timers and expensive for enthusiasts.

> In this workshop, you'll learn how to keep a bonsai alive, healthy and attractive. We will identify cheap alternatives to some expensive traditional tools and materials, and help you seek out trees suitable for the beginner on a budget.

> Together we will explore:

> + The history and aesthetics of bonsai: what characteristics are prized by enthusiasts and why.

> + How to find and select suitable trees and pots for use as bonsai starter material.

> + How to keep a bonsai alive, and why this is so much harder than for a typical pot plant.

> + Going beyond survival: the support a tree needs to thrive as a bonsai.

> The workshop will provide you with hands-on experience of key bonsai activities such as repotting, wiring and pruning. You will go away with your very own beginner's bonsai... perhaps the first of your future collection!

> This course is suitable for all levels of horticultural experience; no gardening experience required. Basic material will be provided, including appropriate seedlings, but participants are also welcome to bring their own.

> If bringing a tree, please email us its species, approximate dimensions, and whether it has previously been treated as a bonsai after booking.

"CV" as used, for future reference:

> Alex developed a bonsai addiction shortly before the pandemic, just in time to fill in for actual face-to-face contact. When not training under his instructor, the bonsai expert Mark d'Cruz, Alex favours an iterative scientific approach to horticultural learning - and, having consequently killed more trees than Bolsonaro, is keen to share his accumulated knowledge of What Not To Do.
