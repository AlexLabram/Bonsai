### Forward planning

I would very much like to produce a re-useable resource here, rather than yet another pile of personal notes.  Ideally the end-game would be to put together a reasonably comprehensive resource, a la Wikibooks, at least for the basics.  (Alternatively, there's a pay-what-you-want site for technical books... which I've forgotten the URL of.  D'oh.)

Relatedly, I will probably end up licensing this under [CC-BY](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/cc-by-4.0/) or similar... but I can't commit to that yet because the repository may temporarily include more stringently-licensed files (e.g. scanned images from books used as placeholders) until I can replace them with my own content.  In the meantime, please drop me a line if you would like to reuse anything; it is almost certain that I'll say yes.

...As of 2024, I've surrendered to the need to produce a pretty Powerpoint deck in addition to any long-form writing.  The desire to bookify this remains, but it does make it easier to keep track of the big picture.  The below to-do list has not yet been updated.

### To do
+ Finish first draft of outline
+ Identify most critical areas for course
+ Flesh out into training deck/notes + presenter's notes
	- Make sure headings are aligned with summary
+ Make bounty board of: tree photos/drawings; diagrams; tabular info
	- Or stub in fake diagrams and use the issue tracker?

#### Bounty board

Diagrams
+ Bonsai lifecycle
+ Common species identification:
	- outdoor bonsai
	- indoor bonsai
	- world map with climate bands and common tree origin markers?
	- London self-seeded trees
	- London weeds
	- London pests (and non-pests)
+ Bonsai history timeline and/or map
+ Bonsai style diagrams (source from e.g. wikimedia commons?)
+ Tree science 101:
	- enablers of growth
	- limiters of growth
	- types of growth
+ Proportion and area of effect for each nutrient
+ Causes of death:
	- my first bonsai
	- year 1 enthusiast
	- experienced practitioner
+ Climate change 101 (for bonsai specialists):
	- rising GST
	- shifting climate bands
	- London-specific results: see [UKCP](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/index)
+ Wild vs potted tree roots (?)
+ Standard pot layout (wire, mesh, soil, tree, sphag)
+ Wiring patterns (from base; two-branch; fork)
+ Pruning guide
+ Example "tree plans" - original tree pic + diagram + final tree pick

Photos
+ Alex's wall o' bonsai
+ Japanese, Chinese and Nonsai groups of styles

Technical appendices
+ Care sheet - DONE!
+ Detailed task guidance
	- re-potting
	- wiring
+ Table of low-budget substitutes

### Running version of presentation deck
+ [Powerpoint version](https://github.com/AlexLabram/Bonsai/raw/main/Courseware/Bonsai%20On%20A%20Budget%20%28running%29.pptx)
+ [Most recent PDF snapshot](https://github.com/AlexLabram/Bonsai/raw/main/Courseware/tags/Bonsai%20On%20A%20Budget%20%282025-04-05%29.pdf)

Look at this if you want my latest greatest thoughts!  The rest of the list is for historical reference in case someone wants a soft copy of precisely the deck they saw on the projector screen.

The PDF version is the one linked to from my site's menu bar, FYI.

### Walworth October 2024 presentation

### Walworth April 2024 presentation
+ [As presented](https://github.com/AlexLabram/Bonsai/raw/main/Courseware/tags/Bonsai%20On%20A%20Budget%20%282024-04%29.pptx) - warning: this is 20MB due to uncompressed photos!

Note that both slide decks are missing some later materials.  This isn't an accident: I'm still figuring out how best to break down the topic of pruning, so during the course I stuck to hands-on presentation rather than big-picture theory.  Once I've got a clear picture, I'll update the Live version.

### Topic notes
+ [Tools](https://github.com/AlexLabram/Bonsai/raw/main/Courseware/Bonsai%20Tools.docx)
+ [Fertilisers](https://github.com/AlexLabram/Bonsai/raw/main/Courseware/Bonsai%20Fertilisers.docx)
+ [Sources](https://github.com/AlexLabram/Bonsai/raw/main/Courseware/Bonsai%20Sources.docx)
+ [Pests](https://github.com/AlexLabram/Bonsai/raw/main/Courseware/Bonsai%20Pests.docx)
+ [Mosses](https://github.com/AlexLabram/Bonsai/raw/main/Courseware/Bonsai%20Mosses.docx)

These are up-to-date compilations of my understanding of each topic, on a relatively in-depth basis and from a bonsai practitioner's perspective.

### Archive - Walworth 2023 materials
+ [Course contents listing](tags/IntroContents.md): because this list includes the practicals, which may vary depending on course location and resources
+ [Bonsai theory](tags/TheoryMain.md): the meat of the courseware
+ [Practical exercises](tags/IntroPracticals.md): split off because they don't follow the same structure as the theory, and may vary slightly depending on course location and resources (e.g. if I start doing a higher-budget bonsai bootcamp)
+ [April 2023 event page](tags/2023-04_WGIntro.md) for non-reuseable info

These are scribbled bullet points intended mostly as presenter's notes. Once I've confirmed that nothing too important is missing from the slide decks, they'll be removed.
