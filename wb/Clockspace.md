# Clockspace

...The name "clockspace" actually sounds like it should refer to something far more convoluted than Yet Another Space Opera.  Answers on a postcard for what that Something should be.

Possibly also needs a different name for the Empire - [this guy](https://www.amazon.com/Steven-Harper/e/B001HCW8M8/ref=dp_byline_cont_pop_book_1) arguably got there first.  Although perhaps there's enough difference between "this place is called that" and "people insult it with this name"?

## Elevator pitch

It is called the Clockwork Empire by its foreign detractors.  But to its citizens it is just the Place.  An area of space encompassing a whole third of the Perseus arm, and containing millions of worlds and world-like objects.  All managed for a thousand years by the Overseer, an omnipresent computer system that seeks to create the best possible universe.


## Open questions

+ A history of failed attempts to subvert the Overseer.
+ How the Overseer came out as benevolent as it did.  A cabal of programmers effectively betrayed their corporate employers to produce a system that - rather than simply maximising profits - would seek to do the right thing (c.f. the Story of Mel).  Story ends when the Overseer is set running and essentially goes Skynet on its creators, leaving the Big Boss cursing impotently as he is locked out of his own company.
+ The outskirts of the system: how it expands, how it supports fringe communities without suffocating them, and when it intervenes regardless.  Pretty much a Special Circumstances expy.
  - What happens to people who leave the system?  How do they deal with the sudden sense that their house of cards has no cards on the bottom layer?  Worst case: Vault-dwellers in Fallout; Star Trek: Voyager.
  - How an unconstrained strong AI can inveigle its way into an economic and political system, and how that process can be resisted?
+ The innards of the system: how it helps humans up Maslow's Pyramid and finds useful, meaningful roles for them even in the face of automation.
  - Essentially this bit would act as something of a manifesto for benevolent government, particularly focusing on preventative medicine and actions likely to improve mental health.
  - Psychotherapy, resource-unconstrained robot style: attempting to disentangle our sense of self-respect and security from our ability to control and take from others - or at least mitigate / channel it - since sapient subordinates are the one thing it can't simply print more of.
    - Cue discussion of where value truly resides in a post-scarcity world with security considerations handled "off-screen"
    - How the more sociopathic members of society resist this, and the range of options the Overseer has for channeling their impulses.
+ How do nearby polities handle the 1000-pound gorilla in their midst?  How do their citizens react?
  - Incidentally illustrates the distinction between the Overseer's different modes of inter-polity operation: co-operation, competition and conflict.
  - How does it deal with mutually-destructive idiocy?  E.g. another polity decides to peg its currency - and, more importantly, its debt - to the Cog (clockwork credit).  This will inevitably lead to disaster next time the Overseer needs to tighten or loosen monetary policy, with the other polity reacting as the tip of the whip.
  - Dealing with refugees
+ How can such a system permit the existence of scientific, engineering and philosophical development without falling apart at the seams?  What happens when humans start buying into some particularly noxious idea?  What about when some truly revolutionary technology comes along?  The Overseer would need to reframe itself, reorient itself, and reshape its plans.
  - Two new roles: "troublemakers" to identify limitations and weaknesses of the system under semi-controlled circumstances, and "pathbreakers" to help the Overseer think its way out of any particularly nasty corners and to codify the new habits of thought thus needed in terms the Overseer can understand.
    - Large parts of the Clockwork Empire could essentially exist as a personnel pipeline for a few key troublemakers / pathbreakers permitted to work with core systems.
+ How the Overseer handles genuine pathology and antisociality.  Stick them in the Matrix?  Grouping of people with complementary lunacies?
  - What can we learn from it about our own handling of mental health?
  - How the Overseer can assist with and/or prevent breakdown of the narrative mind
    - Basic process/operation training
    - Stress diagnostics
    - Holidays from reason
  - Mental health as a core subject alongside sexual health?
    - It would be *really* hard to do this IRL because popular discussion of the mind is so ridden with religious associations
    - ...Speaking of which, how would the Overseer handle religion and dogma?  Both as a dubiously-sane concept to be promoted/suppressed in general, and as something that might be targeted at it in particular.
  - Aggressive gerontocracy and the formation of exclusionary preference networks
    - Formalising and successfully sharing knowledge/skills as a much greater virtue than simply applying it
    - ...but how to handle this with the fluffiest kinds of knowledge?  To what extent is running an organisation *not* merely the sum of running all its departments?
  - Before touching this field with a bargepole, I will need to do a *lot* of reading.  DSM-5, here I come!

## Inspirations

+ Iain M Banks' Culture novels: these are the quintessential liberal techno-utopia, but frankly he's dead now and we need a new generation of same.
+ Asimov:
  - Trantor from the Foundation series: grandeur crumbling
  - The (First) Foundation itself vs the Mule: sense of the wheels falling off a previously-invincible system
  - The system (name?) from I, Robot (book not film): computer that is genuinely a benevolent overlord
+ Doctor Who: worlds and species shamelessly defined by their gimmick
  - Generally I hate this style of worldbuilding: in any natural stable human population, intra-group diversity will usually dramatically exceed any routine differences vs another such group.  That should extend to other species: using Mass Effect as an example, a particularly diplomatic Salarian should be better at it than a particularly techie Asari, and this should show up in the employment numbers unless there's a shitload of systemic bias (which is itself entirely plausible).
  - However, if I never write anything simple then I'll never write anything complex.  And if it's good enough for J. K. Rowling (cough*Gringotts*cough) then it's good enough for me... at least to start with.
  - Good chance to start building up a database of gimmick-worlds, which I can then use as-is or repurpose into societies within another universe.
+ MCU's Kree Empire, except non-evil... probably?
+ Any other story I write about AI will go into detail on how it works.  This story is the opposite; it's about normal people's inability to comprehend the system.
+ Caelum Est Conterrens (the scariest MLP fanfic in existence): paperclip maximisation and its dangers.

## Plot entry points

+ The Overseer is self-repairing... mostly.  One tiny gimbal in its centre, whose function is not fully understood ("we know it's something to do with regulation of intent..."), is completely irreplaceable by normal means.  Cue a Macguffin fetch quest by an oddball group who have inexplicably been tapped to get a replacement from a lost location based on obscure clues.
  - ...The punchline being that the gimbal is in fact a human brain in a box, which functions as a decision-maker of last resort and a defence against both rampancy and subversion.  And the oddballs have been chosen as a microcosm of the Clockwork Empire, to ensure that the selected brain is able to comprehend the full range of human activities.
