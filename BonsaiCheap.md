# How to Do Bonsai (on the Cheap)

<details>

## Meta - remove before release

### To do
+ Finish first draft of outline
+ Identify most critical areas for course
+ Discuss course date (best for repotting / pruning?), length, attendance, budgets, prep (tree availability), etc with Oli
+ Flesh out into training deck/notes + presenter's notes
+ Questions for Mark d'Cruz:
	- I have the vague sense that micronutrient fertilisation keeps the tree functioning whilst NPK lets it put on bulk.  Is this correct?

## Intro to bonsai (on the cheap)

### Why we appreciate bonsai
+ Bonsai brings nature into unnatural environments
	- Home / office (for short periods or "indoor" species)
	- Formal garden
+ Bonsai has style
	- Japanese style: naturalistic
	- Chinese style: gargoyle
	- Western rube style: "I Can't Believe It's Not Bonsai"
+ Bonsai has history
	- India: xxxx
	- Buddhism: xxxx
	- China: xxxx
	- Japan: xxxx
	- Bonsai diaspora: xxxx
+ Bonsai has convenience
	- ...At least compared to a full tree / garden
	- xxxx Example: Alex's wall o' bonsai
+ Bonsai is educational and therapeutic
	- Improves awareness of what a tree needs to survive
	- Tactile and artistic elements
	- Become the god of a tiny world

### Practical 1: Bonsai display
+ Which is your favourite and why?
+ Do they look better from a particular angle?
+ Which ones look more natural (Japanese style) or grotesque (Chinese style)?

### How we appreciate bonsai
- Styles
	- Japanese styles: xxxx show pictures here
	- Chinese styles: xxxx show pictures here
	- Bunjingi: Japanese style based on imported Chinese ([Southern Song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_School)) woodcuts
	- Misc others e.g. Pierneef style
+ Qualities
	- Appearance of age
		- Ramification
		- "Nebari" (root flare - one of three japanese words you want to know)
		- Proportionality (where possible)
	- Spread
		- Focus
		- Dynamism
		- Negative space
	- Special features
		- Extreme size (either small or large)
		- Flowers / fruit
		- Integral deadwood / rocks
+ Misc fluff
	- Buddhist principles
	- General Japanese-ness
		- Minimalism: contra "I have made this longer than usual because I have not had time to make it shorter."
		- Appearance of austerity: "the art that conceals art"
		- Kodak moments, long before Kodak!

### Practical 2: Seeing with new eyes
Quick wander round Walworth Gardens
+ Mature trees: spot the features that make them look old
+ Young trees: spot the _lack_ of these features
+ Heavily styled trees: what would you need to do to produce a bonsai?

Alternatively, stay inside and flick through a bonsai book!

### How bonsai get to that point:
+ Created from non-bonsai "material"
	- Choice of species
		- Outdoor (Japanese style) vs indoor (Chinese style)
			- Casual bonsai owners trying to keep an outdoor tree indoors is the single biggest killer of bonsai
		- Broadleaf vs conifer
		- Cladistic ~~tree~~ diagram
	- Sources
		- seeds (serious enthusiasts only!  Ignore "grow your own bonsai" kits)
		- cuttings from mature bonsai
		- non-bonsai seedlings/whips (esp. for "literati" styles)
		- non-bonsai mature trees
+ Kept alive for years / decades
	- Watering (!!!)
	- Pest control (!)
	- Heat
	- Light
	- Fertilising (micronutrients)
	- Air circulation (?)
+ Given treatment that lets them thrive (in the desired directions)
	- Cleaning & weeding
	- Fertilising (NPK)
	- Repotting - force a strong root ball rather than unnecessary deep/wide roots
	- Pruning - recapitulate the natural history of branch death
	- Wiring - recapitulate the natural history of branch strain / light-seeking
+ ...Occasional drastic action
	- Extreme Styling™
		- Trunk splitting
		- Grafting
		- Deadwood styling: jin (bare branch), shari (bare trunk), uro (cavity), sabamiki (split trunk)
	- Extreme Potting™
		- Root-over-rock style
		- Root-on-rock style
		- Moss ball ("kokedama")
		- Multiple tree styles
	- Extreme Propagating™
		- Layering
		- Air layering
		- Just cutting big chunks off an existing bonsai
	- Sticking the tree back in the ground to grow out
	- ...This section not discussed further here (we're focused on survive+thrive)
+ Prepping for display
	- Pot aesthetics
		- shape/finish/decoration
		- "masculine" vs "feminine"
	- Ornaments, accent plants and display rocks
	- Last-minute fixes: moss, small branch wiring
	- Stands & displays
	- ...This section not discussed further here (we're focused on survive+thrive)
+ End-of-life
	- Resale
		- Bonsai pricing gets very complicated!
		- Good record-keeping is important if you ever plan to sell on
	- Soil from dead plants can often be recycled if dried and sieved
	- ...This section not discussed further here (we're focused on survive+thrive)
+ xxxx Lifecycle diagram

### Doing it on the cheap
+ Easy ways to start bonsai:
	- Mature bonsai (i.e. large trunk relative to pot; good distinctive shape; has stopped trying too hard to grow)
	- Large numbers (nurseries)
	- Large pots (water control)
	- Lots of outside growing space, light/shade, etc
	- Good-quality specialist tools & materials (pots, soils, wire etc)
	- Experienced bonsai instructor
+ ...these all take £££ (or apprenticeship)
+ The alternative: YOLO / for science!
	- Cheap material: "urban yamadori", seeds/cuttings, knocked-down stock, rescued ICBINB
	- Improvised tools
	- Iterative: expect many to die; goal is to learn from mistakes
	- Training sources: Youtube, community, amateur instructors (!)
+ If your tree is healthy and attractive, how you got there is less important
	- Corollary: real bonsai practitioners know their way round power tools >:-D

### Practical 3: Choose your bonsai / pot
+ Tree types on offer
	- Bring your own (free, obviously)
	- "Urban yamadori" samples (free)
	- Selected cheaply-sourced trees... i.e. anything I spot at Tesco (free)
	- Walworth Gardens stock (as priced)
		- ... but we don't recommend you spend too much cos you're probably going to kill it
+ Pot types on offer
	- Improvised / "recycled" (free)
	- Drilled china (free... especially if you bring your own!)
	- Concrete (free)
	- Plastic bonsai training pot (free? xxxx)
	- Ceramic (as priced)
+ Considerations
	- The tree must in principle be able to fit in the pot!
	- Pot appropriate to tree
	- Pot appropriate to style (e.g. deep pots for cascade)
	- Speak to me before buying any trees so I can confirm that they're suitable

## Caring for your bonsai

### Why is it so f***ing difficult?
+ The practitioner is God... and this is the downside
+ Must provide everything that trees usually get from the environment / ecosystem

### Watering
+ Significance
	- Mis-watering is the second biggest killeer of bonsai
	- Under-watering: root hairs (microscopic) die off
	- Over-watering: root rot sets in (esp. when overcompensating for under-watering!)
	- Trad. bonsai soil drains well but is esp. prone to drying out completely
+ When to water
	- Back-of-hand test
	- Varies based on: bonsai/pot size; season (and location); species
+ Approaches:
	1. Dunking
		- Fill a bowl or basin with water
		- Place bonsai in water with water level slightly below the soil surface
		- Wait until surface is visibly wet before removing (may take longer or shorter depending on soil type, dryness, how long bonsai has been in pot)
		- Suitable for up to about 5 bonsai; any more and it starts to take forever
		- Water impurities tend to be driven upwards over time; water from the top occasionally to rinse them away
		- Solid fertiliser will just sit on the surface; use liquid feed instead
	1. "Bottle feeding"
		- Buy a small spray bottle and (empty) ketchup squeezy bottle and fill with water
		- Use spray bottle to wet the surface of the soil (or dried sphagnum) to break the surface tension
		- Gently squeeze water into the soil from close range; pause when the surface gets waterlogged; stop when water starts coming out the bottom
		- Suitable for up to about 10 bonsai
		- Appropriate for indoor bonsai where getting water everywhere is a bad thing
	1. Watering can
		- Buy a watering can with a slanted rose (e.g. Haws 700ml)
		- Water _three_ times per pot: once to break the surface tension, once to wet the upper soil, once to go right through; leave a short pause in between
		- Suitable for ~40-50 outdoor bonsai
		- Less suitable for indoor due to mess, and gets more time-consuming in hot weather (up to 1/2 hour per day!)
	1. Garden hose spray nozzle
		- Easiest approach for large bonsai collections, but requires more up-front effort

### Practical 4: Preparing your pot
1. If needed, clean the pot in water, using a toothbrush to get rid of any encrusted dirt
1. Cut a suitable chunk of mesh, and use short sections of 2mm wire to fix it in place over the drainage hole
	- Repeat as needed if there are multiple holes
	- If the pot is rectangular, oval or obround, make sure that the mesh wire(s) is pointing along the pot's central axis
	- Trim any excess wire off with the bonsai wire-cutters
		- This step isn't vital for newbies; it's just to stop loose ends of wire scratching a display surface
1. Cut two longer sections of 1.5mm wire ("anchor wires") and push their ends up through the pot's drainage hole(s) (or wire holes if it has them)
	- If the pot has wire holes or multiple drainage holes, run the wire between them
	- If the pot has only one hole, make a V in the middle of each anchor wire and push them up straddling the mesh wire (one at each end)
	- Attach the wires asymmetrically, with longer ends on one side of the pot and shorter ends on the other, so that you're not trying to twist the ends together directly over a root
	- Don't cross anchor wires over each other underneath the pot
1. Smooth the anchor wire against the sides of the pot, and fold the excess down over the rim
	- I find it helpful to put an extra upwards bend in the longer wire, so that I can remember which was supposed to be which...

### Pest control
+ Significance
	- Pest infestations are the third biggest killer of bonsai
		- ...Also often the final nail in the coffin when keeping outdoor trees indoors
	- Many pests that would typically be taken care of by a tree's ecosystem (birds, other insects, etc) become far more dangerous for bonsai
+ Leaf pests
	- Aphids / greenfly
	- Spider mites
	- Leaf miners (fly larvae)
	- Weevils
+ Root pests
	- Grubs (e.g. vine weevil larvae/pupae)
	- Ants
	- (Some) nematodes
+ Not all wrigglies are pests!
	- Earthworms
	- Springtails
	- Woodlice
	- Ladybirds
+ Management
	- Natural + focused: ladybirds, nematodes, predatory mites
	- Natural + broad-spectrum: neem oil or similar
	- Artificial: chemicals

### Heat
+ Significance
	- Plants evolved for specific climate
	- Indoor (Chinese) bonsai
		- Adapted for year-round warmth / tropical undergrowth
		- Common species: ficus (fig), chinese elm, tea tree, Buddhist pine
		- Year-round warmth
		- Dies if too cold
	- Outdoor (Japanese) bonsai
		- Adapted for cold winters
		- Common species: maple, juniper, <etc etc etc>
		- Dies of terminal confusion without a dormancy period
		- esp. wrt dormancy for outdoor, chills for indoor
+ Management
	- Keep indoor bonsai indoors
		- ... and don't leave them on a cold windowsill in January!
	- Ensure you have an outdoor space where you can leave bonsai for 2-3 months over winter
		- ... or, in extreme cases, a suitable cold-box or refrigerator!
	- If leaving ceramic pots outdoors in cold winters
+ Climate change shout-out
	- Some tree species may increasingly struggle to go dormant over winter
	- Especially true in cities such as London ("heat island effect")

### Light
+ Significance
	- There's this thing called "photosynthesis", y'know?
	- Quantity (lumens) vs colour (wavelength)
	- Too little: leaves die
	- Too much: leaves scorch
+ Management
	- Measurement options include expensive light measurement tools... or freebie phone apps!
	- Alternatively, ignore this unless your plants start losing leaves or dying
	- In mid-summer it may be necessary to move trees into shade or put up awnings
+ Climate change shout-out
	- Scorching in summer is becoming a huge problem
		- ... especially - but not only - for japanese maples

### Fertilising for health
+ Significance
	- Micronutrients are needed for day-to-day plant metabolism
	- Too little: leaves go funny colours, tree mysteriously dies
	- Far too much: tree is poisoned
+ Management
	- High-quality organic fertilisers: biogold etc
		- Pellets of organic matter (bonemeal etc)
		- Fermented first - stops rodents eating them!
	- Cheap commercial fertilisers: seaweed juice etc
	- Plant tonics: xxxx can't really comment on these

### Air circulation
+ Significance
	- There are these things called "oxygen", "carbon dioxide" and "dust"...
	- Too little: plant generally unhealthy
	- Too much: plant blows over or loses leaves
+ Is this a big deal?
	- My instructor reckons good air-flow is necessary for plant health
	- I'm not convinced it makes a difference for trees, except insofar as some pests dislike fresh air
	- Mosses _are_ heavily affected by air-flow, but don't usually need much of it to be happy
+ Management: windows, fans

### Practical 5: De-potting your bonsai
1. Remove existing pot (taking off wire if needed) and place in tray provided
1. Brush all moss, weeds and excess soil off top surface with chopstick
	- This uncovers the nebari... or, for young trees, the lateral roots that will eventually help form it
	- Keep an eye open for any signs of pests in the soil
1. If trunk is dirty or moss-covered, clean with a damp toothbrush
	- Moss on trunks looks cool but is bad for the tree's health
1. Decide how you'd like the tree to sit in the pot
	a. Angle: Usually we want the tree to emerge vertically, but a few styles get more creative
	a. "Front": We must establish the direction from which the tree is intended to be viewed
	a. Positioning: Asymmetric styles may work better with the tree off to one side
	- This decision may need re-visiting if the roots don't behave like you expect; in the worst case you may have to change pot
1. Trim off any roots that were growing along the sides of the pot
1. Work the roots back to fit in the pot
	1. Loosen dirt round the edges / bottom with chopstick
	1. Trim off exposed roots with root shears (or nail scissors!)
		- Big roots may need a branch cutter (or secateurs)
		- _Really_ big roots may need a saw!
	1. Repeat until tree fits in pot with 1/2 cm clearance at sides and bottom
1. Squirt any exposed roots with water

## Developing your bonsai

### Cleaning & weeding
+ Significance
	- Dead leaves and twigs look unattractive and give pests hiding spots
	- Weeds contend for nutrients with the tree, and for space with moss
+ Common weeds
	- Pearlwort: mini-grass, sometimes confusingly called Irish Moss
	- Liverwort: flat green splodges
	- Oxalis (aka wood sorrel): three-leaved clover-like plant
	- Nostoc: small blobs of green gloop
	- Grass
+ Management
	- Remove dead leaves regularly, and dead twigs once you're _sure_ they're dead
	- Remove weeds when they get too obvious and/or when you re-pot, prune or wire
	- A lot of weeds can be used as "accent plants"... but not in the main bonsai pot!
	- Be aware that liverwort and nostoc can be signs of over-watering

### Fertilising for growth
+ Significance
	- Without macronutrient infusions, a bonsai will at best stay as-is... and at worst wither and die
	- Too much fertiliser can build up in the soil and stop roots absorbing water via osmosis
		- "Salt the earth" is an idiom for a reason!
+  Macronutrients 
	- Nitrogen: important for leaf growth
	- Phosphorus (or P2O5 to be precise): important for root growth
	- Potassium (or K2O): important for flower and fruit growth
	- Fertilisers are assessed by their "NPK values": N vs P2O5 vs K2O
+ Management
	- Bonsai practitioners typically use a "balanced" fertiliser: e.g. "5-5-5" or "7-7-7"
	- A lot of organic fertilisers are approximately balanced - good enough!
	- Cheap balanced liquid fertilisers readily available from stores
	- If fertilising heavily, keep an eye out for crystals forming on surface of soil

### Repotting (including root pruning)
+ Significance
	- Root pruning forces the creation of a strong root ball rather than unnecessary deep/wide roots
		- We don't need tap-roots; we have wire!
		- We don't need lateral roots (unless they look cool); we have watering cans!
		- We don't want long roots; we have small pots!
	- Failing to re-pot regularly can lead to trees becoming pot-bound, affecting water retention (cos there's no soil left to retain it!)
+ Soil choice xxxx
+ Management
	- Re-pot every one or two years
		- Two years is the traditional consensus, but my instructor reckons that re-potting every year is better for mature bonsai
		- Always re-pot if the tree has become pot-bound or if lots of roots are trying to escape out of the drainage holes

### Practical 6a: Anchoring your bonsai
1. Put a layer of (dry) bonsai soil along the bottom of the pot
1. Position the tree as desired
1. Fill in the gaps around the root ball with more soil
1. Compress the soil down as much as possible
	- Make a first attempt using your thumbs, adding more soil as needed
	- Afterwards, tap the pot gently with a (non-metal) mallet or similar, to help the soil flow into any cavities
	- If the root ball is a weird shape, a bit of fiddling with chopsticks may be required to fill in the gaps
1. Grab one of the anchor wires' long end, guide it past the trunk, and pull it slowly and gently towards the short end until it hooks on the root ball.
1. Pull the corresponding short end gently up until it also hooks on the root ball
1. Gently twist the wires together with your fingers
	- Ideally you should ensuring that the meeting point isn't directly on top of a root
1. Repeat the last two steps with the other anchor wire
1. Twist the wire ends together with pliers until all the slack is taken up
	- This is tricky: you almost certainly will break a lot of wire as you learn!
	- Pull the wire gently as you twist it, so that the newly taken up wire doesn't wrap on top of the previous twists
	- Keep the twisted wire at the same angle to both single strands (the "bisector" in maths jargon) so that neither strand gets twisted more sharply than the other
	- Broken wire can be patched together with an extra length of 1.5mm wire
	- Traditionally you'd use "jin pliers" for this, but I find needle-tip pliers just as good
1. Repeat the last step with the other anchor wire
1. Remove any excess anchor wire
	- It's generally best to retain 3-4 turns of the twisted wire
	- You may want to snip off any _really_ excessive bits of wire before using the pliers to tighten it, so they don't smack into the tree every turn!
1. Once the tree is anchored in place, thoroughly water the bonsai (e.g. by dunking)

### Practical 6b: Covering your soil
1. Grate some dry sphagnum through a xxxx cm mesh sieve
	- We've done this bit for you
1. Put a handful in a pot and mix with water
	- Sphagnum absorbs a lot of moisture - if you can't see free water then you haven't added enough
1. Transfer the mix a large pinch at a time to your pot, covering the entire surface with about 0.5cm of loosely-packed spagnum
1. Gently press down with your fingers, squeezing the spagnum against the soil
	- This also squeezes a lot of the water out of the sphagnum, which causes it to bind to itself like pressed felt
	- If you've got a big patch of soil to cover, be careful that pushing on one side doesn't send soil flying out of another!

### Pruning
+ Significance
	- Pruning is what makes a bonsai look _right_
	- Short inter-node distance
	- Ramification and fractal growth
	- Can promote smaller leaf growth
	- Stops the tree needing more water than the (small pot) roots can provide
		- Tree branch-to-root ratio
	- Shape / style
		- Often trying to recapitulate an imaginary natural history of the tree
+ Management
	- Broad-leaved trees
		1. When shoots grow past about 5 nodes, trim tips
			- Prevents trees wasting effort on stuff you'll only cut off later
			- Exception is if you _want_ the tree to grow more in that direction (i.e. trunk or primary branch)
		1. When secondary budding ("Lammas growth") starts, prune back to 3 active (buddable) nodes for alternate-leaf species, or 2 active nodes for opposite-leaf species 
			- Encourages "inner growth" (i.e. stops tree getting lanky)
			- Third node is "sacrificial": intended to be removed at a later date
		1. When growth is slow, but tree is not currently dormant, prune heavily if needed
			- "Structural" pruning reduces tree size or changes formal style
		1. Remove unwanted growth as it appears, including:
			- excess shoots from "congested" nodes - i.e. those that already have enough growth
			- unwanted "adventitious" shoots - i.e. those that appear randomly in the middle of a stretch of bark
			- suckers rising from roots
	- Conifers
		- Making sure your conifer survives pruning
			- In conifers, water is sucked up by pressure from the leaves/needles - without them, the tree dies of thirst!
			- Thus, never cut off too many leaves and branches at once
			- If cutting the trunk back, always make sure there is a strong branch below the cut
			- Note that some conifers (esp. yews) are also sensitive to cutting off too much root mass at once
		- Conifer branches are typically arranged into horizontal "pads", with clear gaps (negative space) between them
			- A pad should start a little way out from the trunk, so prune off any small branches or leaves right next to it
			- 
		- xxxx still 
	- Remember: Don't sweat the small stuff!
+ Timetable for outdoor deciduous trees
	- Tip-trimming: early in year (optional)
	- Lammas pruning: some time in summer
	- Structural pruning: start or end of year
+ Timetable for indoor trees: there is no timetable, it's all as-needed!

### Practical 7a: Designing the tree
1. If you have a smartphone, look up some pictures of what an adult tree of your chosen species might look like in the wild
	- Does it normally grow straight, or does it twist all over the place?
	- Is the leaf dome tall and narrow or short and broad?
	- Do the branches angle upwards or downwards as they leave the trunk?
	- Do the branches follow a single curve or a series of stepped arcs?  Are the arcs up-and-out or down-and-in?
1. Draw a doodle of how you'd like your tree to look, taking note of the positioning of major branches on its trunk
