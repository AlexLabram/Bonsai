# How to Do Bonsai (on the Cheap)

## Meta - remove before release

### To do
+ Finish first draft of outline
+ Identify most critical areas for course
+ Discuss course date (best for repotting / pruning?), length, attendance, budgets, prep (tree availability), etc with Oli
+ Flesh out into training deck/notes + presenter's notes
+ Questions for Mark d'Cruz:
	- I have the vague sense that micronutrient fertilisation keeps the tree functioning whilst NPK lets it put on bulk.  Is this correct?

## Intro to bonsai (on the cheap)

### Why we appreciate bonsai
+ Bonsai brings nature into the home
+ Bonsai has style
	- Japanese style / naturalistic / outdoor species
	- Chinese style / gargoyle / indoor species
	- "I Can't Believe It's Not Bonsai"
+ Bonsai has history
+ Bonsai has convenience (kinda...)

### How we appreciate bonsai
+ Japanese styles
+ Qualities
	- Appearance of age
		- Ramification
		- "Nebari" (root flare - one of three japanese words you want to know)
		- Proportionality (where possible)
	- Spread
		- Focus
		- Dynamism
	- Special features: extreme size, flowers / fruit, integral deadwood / rocks
+ Misc fluff
	- Buddhist principles
	- General Japanese-ness

### How bonsai get to that point:
+ Created from non-bonsai "material"
	- Choice of species
		- Cladistic ~~tree~~ diagram
		- Outdoor vs indoor
		- Broadleaf vs conifer
	- Choice of style
		- Japanese vs chinese <=> outdoor vs indoor
	- Sources: seeds, cuttings, non-bonsai seedlings/whips, non-bonsai mature trees
+ Kept alive for decades
	- Watering (!!!)
	- Pest control (!)
	- Heat (esp. wrt dormancy for outdoor, chills for indoor)
	- Light
	- Fertilising (micronutrients)
	- Air circulation (?)
+ Given treatment that lets them thrive (in the desired directions)
	- Cleaning & weeding
	- Fertilising (NPK)
	- Pruning (recapitulate the natural history)
	- Repotting (force a strong root ball rather than unnecessary deep/wide roots)
+ ...Occasional drastic action
	- Extreme Styling
		- trunk splitters
		- grafting
		- deadwood styling: jin, shari, uro
	- Extreme Potting
		- root over rock
		- root on rock
		- kokedama
		- forests
	- Extreme Propagating
		- Layering
		- Air layering
		- Just cutting big chunks off
	- Sticking in ground to grow out
	- This section not discussed further here
+ Prepping for display
	- Pot aesthetics: shape/finish/decoration, "masculine" vs "feminine"
	- Ornaments, accent plants and display rocks
	- Last-minute fixes: moss, small branch wiring
	- Stands & displays
	- This section not discussed further here
+ End-of-life
	- Recycling soil etc
+ <Lifecycle diagram>

### Doing it on the cheap
+ Easy ways to start bonsai:
	- Mature bonsai (i.e. large trunk relative to pot; good distinctive shape; has stopped trying too hard to grow)
	- Large numbers (nurseries)
	- Large pots (water control)
	- Lots of outside growing space, light/shade, etc
	- Good-quality specialist tools & materials (pots, soils, wire etc)
	- Experienced bonsai instructor
+ ...these all take £££ (or apprenticeship)
+ The alternative: YOLO / for science!
	- Cheap material: "urban yamadori", seeds/cuttings, knocked-down stock, rescued ICBINB
	- Improvised tools
	- Iterative: expect many to die; goal is to learn from mistakes
	- Training sources: Youtube, community, amateur instructors (!)
+ If your tree is healthy and attractive, how you got there is less important
	- Corollary: real bonsai practitioners know their way round power tools >:-D

## Caring for your bonsai

### Why is it so f***ing difficult?

+ The practitioner is God
+ What trees naturally get from the environment (that we provide)

### Watering
+ Significance
	- This _is_ what will kill your first few bonsai!
	- Under-watering: root hairs (microscopic) die off
	- Over-watering: root rot sets in (esp. when overcompensating)
	- Trad. bonsai soil drains well but is esp. prone to drying out completely
+ When to water
	- Back-of-hand test
	- Varies based on: bonsai/pot size; season (and location); species
+ Approaches:
	1. Dunking
		- Fill a bowl or basin with water
		- Place bonsai in water with water level slightly below the soil surface
		- Wait until surface is visibly wet before removing (may take longer or shorter depending on soil type, dryness, how long bonsai has been in pot)
		- Suitable for up to about 5 bonsai; any more and it starts to take forever
		- Water impurities tend to be driven upwards over time; water from the top occasionally to rinse them away
		- Solid fertiliser will just sit on the surface; use liquid feed instead
	1. "Bottle feeding"
		- Buy a small spray bottle and (empty) ketchup squeezy bottle and fill with water
		- Use spray bottle to wet the surface of the soil (or dried sphagnum) to break the surface tension
		- Gently squeeze water into the soil from close range; pause when the surface gets waterlogged; stop when water starts coming out the bottom
		- Suitable for up to about 10 bonsai
		- Appropriate for indoor bonsai where getting water everywhere is a bad thing
	1. Watering can
		- Buy a watering can with a slanted rose (e.g. Haws 700ml)
		- Water _three_ times per pot: once to break the surface tension, once to wet the upper soil, once to go right through; leave a short pause in between
		- Suitable for ~40-50 outdoor bonsai
		- Less suitable for indoor due to mess, and gets more time-consuming in hot weather (up to 1/2 hour per day!)
	1. Garden hose spray nozzle
		- Easiest approach for large bonsai collections, but requires more up-front effort

### Pest control

+ Leaf pests
	- Aphids / greenfly
	- Spider mites
	- Leaf miners (fly larvae)
	- Weevils
+ Root pests
	- Grubs
	- Ants
	- (Some) nematodes
+ Not all wrigglies are pests!
	- Earthworms
	- Springtails
	- Woodlice
	- Ladybirds
+ Management options
	- Natural vs natural-but-lethal vs artifical-but-specific vs ALL TEH CHEMZ

### Heat
+ Significance
	- Plants evolved for specific climate
	- Indoor (Chinese) bonsai
		- Adapted for year-round warmth / tropical undergrowth
		- Common species: ficus (fig), chinese elm, tea tree, Buddhist pine
		- Year-round warmth
		- Dies if too cold
	- Outdoor (Japanese) bonsai
		- Adapted for cold winters
		- Common species: maple, juniper, <etc etc etc>
		- Dies of terminal confusion without a dormancy period
		- esp. wrt dormancy for outdoor, chills for indoor

### Light
+ Significance:
	- There's this thing called "photosynthesis", y'know?
	- Quantity (lumens) vs colour (wavelength)
	- Too little: leaves die
	- Too much: leaves scorch
+ Management options
	- Expensive light measurement tool
	- Phone app
	- Just ignore it unless your plants start dying

### Fertilising for health
+ Significance
	- Micronutrients are needed for day-to-day plant metabolism
	- Too little or too much: leaves go funny colours
+ Management
	- High-quality organic fertilisers: biogold etc
		- Pellets of organic matter (bonemeal etc)
		- Fermented first - stops rodents eating them!
	- Low-quality fertilisers: seaweed juice etc
	- Plant tonics

### Air circulation
+ Significance
	- There are these things called "oxygen", "carbon dioxide" and "dust"...
	- My instructor reckons this is necessary for plant health
	- I reckon that, unless you're sticking your tree in a sealed box, this is not a big deal for trees
	- (Mosses, on the other hand...)
	- Too little: plant generally unhealthy
	- Too much: plant blows over or loses leaves
+ Management: windows, fans

## Developing your bonsai

### Cleaning & weeding

### Fertilising for growth

### Pruning
+ Significance
	- Pruning is what makes a bonsai look _right_
	- Short inter-node distance
	- Ramification and fractals
	- Can encourage smaller leaves
	- Stops the tree needing more water than the (small pot) roots can provide
		- Tree branch-to-root ratio
	- Shape / style
		- Often trying to recapitulate an imaginary natural history of the tree
+ Timetable
	- When shoots grow past about 5 nodes, trim tips
		- Prevents trees wasting effort on stuff you'll only cut off later
		- Exception is if you _want_ the tree to grow more in that direction (i.e. trunk or primary branch)
		- Outdoor bonsai: early in year
		- Indoor bonsai: as needed
	- When secondary budding starts, prune back to 3 active (buddable) nodes
		- Encourages "inner growth" (i.e. stops tree getting lanky)
		- Third node is "sacrificial": intended to be removed at a later date
		- Outdoor bonsai: some time in summer
		- Indoor bonsai: as needed
	- When growth is slow, but tree is not currently dormant, prune heavily if needed
		- Reduces tree size or changes formal style
		- Outdoor bonsai: start or end of year
		- Indoor bonsai: as needed
	- Remove unwanted growth as it appears
		- Includes: excess shoots from "congested" nodes
		- Includes: unwanted "adventitious" shoots - i.e. those that appear randomly in the middle of a stretch of bark
		- Includes: suckers rising from roots

### Repotting
+ Significance
	- Force a strong root ball rather than unnecessary deep/wide roots
	- We don't need tap-roots; we have wire!
	- We don't need lateral roots (unless they're atmospheric); we have watering cans!
	- We don't want long roots; we have small pots!
