# Joint projects

This folder contains work that I've done with or for other creative writers (who I am generously - to myself! - calling my peers).

Unless otherwise stated, this content should be considered the intellectual property of the peer in question, although I reserve the right to reappropriate and expand on it if they fail to take advantage of their "dibs".

## C/W Masters assistance

One of my friends is doing a creative writing uni course and I've offered to help her brainstorm, research technical topics and, most importantly, record the ideas she comes up with when using me as a sounding board.

### Plagiarism statement

I do not believe this sounding-board work constitutes plagiarism in any way, shape or form.  We aren't taking these ideas from anyone else, except in the generic "all art is derivative" sense, and I have no problem with my friend adopting "my" ideas and twisting them however she wishes... or ignoring them, if she finds them as rubbish as I secretly fear they are.  And, let's be honest here, my overall contribution is probably about as helpful as the rubber ducky she talks to in the bath.

If anyone from the course feels I've crossed a line, please get in touch and I'll be happy to step back my support.

### Content

So far I've [halped](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Halping) with:

- [Last Data](LastData.md): a data science-based crime narrative
  - I'm supplying jargon and "industry expertise" (a la [Dilbert](https://dilbert.com/)), to let my friend focus on the actual creative bits.
  - Status: work in progress.  I'm about 2/5 of the way through an initial pass, after which I'll flesh out specific bits as requested.
- [Musical theatre idea](DevilsDue.md): a girl summons a demon because she's lonely; shit goes down
  - I'm a) documenting the ideas we spit-balled, and b) trying to arrange them into some sort of coherent storyline.
  - Status: work in progress.  I've sketched out the overall narrative arc, and now I'm thinking about key points to be introduced in each section / song
