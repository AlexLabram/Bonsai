# Devil's Due (musical theatre)

Name is provisional

## Synopsis

A young girl grows up lonely and ends up summoning a devil for company.  The devil is secretly pure evil but very charming, and with his "support" the girl starts to gain confidence and happiness (despite the vague hints that he's gaslighting her).

However, once this increased confidence manifests in actually making other friends, the devil shows his true colours and starts trying to kill them.  Eventually the girl catche on and rebels, kicking off a big exorcism scene.

(Not yet sure what the aftermath should look like; see below for discussion.)

## Song structure

First priority is to establish what songs go where in the overall story arc; details can be fleshed out later.

Approx 6 songs needed.

Suggested song themes:

1. Loneliness
1. The summoning
1. Growing happiness
1. Devil's malice / scheming
1. Growing fear
1. Exorcism scene / determination
  - He's made my life a hell
  - We'll send him back to hell
  - I'll drag her (the friend) down to hell
1. Reprise

I am reliably informed that I am shit at coming up with song names, so I'll leave that for more competent parties.

## Author's notes

### Devil's deal and aftermath

The biggest hole in this little concept is how it ends.  The devil's banishing must carry some kind of cost, or it will make the tension leading up to it look a bit too artificial.

This question of cost ties into the *other* big hole: what were the terms of the original deal?

One idea I've recently had: if the original deal were for the devil to be "her leading friend, with all others following behind"... this would be a justification for him to drag one of her human friends (last living one?) into hell with him at the end of the exorcism scene.  ~Hell~ Heck of a price there.

I like this outcome because it would set the scene for a spine-tingling reprise: first noting her reinstated loneliness (with associated melody from song #1); then the fact that she is now free to seek happiness (with song #3); but instead she starts wondering if she can save her lost friend (song #4); and ending on a note of rising determination to invade hell and "bring her (friend) back from hell" (per song #6).  Song ends; curtains fall.

My friend, on the other hand, feels that this would leave things a bit too open-ended.  This is further evidence that I'm utter crap at bringing stories to a close.  Further thought needed.
