# Devil's Due (musical theatre)

Name is provisional

## Synopsis

A young girl grows up lonely and ends up summoning a devil for company.  The devil is secretly pure evil but very charming, and with his "support" the girl starts to gain confidence and happiness (despite the vague hints that he's gaslighting her).

However, once this increased confidence manifests in actually making other friends, the devil shows his true colours and starts trying to kill them.  Eventually the girl catche on and rebels, kicking off a big exorcism scene.

(Not yet sure what the aftermath should look like; see below for discussion.)

## Song structure

First priority is to establish what songs go where in the overall story arc; details can be fleshed out later.

Approx 6 songs needed.

Suggested song themes:

1. Loneliness
1. The summoning
1. Growing happiness
1. Devil's malice / scheming
1. Growing fear
1. Exorcism scene / determination
1. Reprise

I am reliably informed that I am shit at coming up with song names, so I'll leave that for more competent parties.

### Loneliness

Song establishes protagonist's character, in particular the fact that she's desperate for company.

Why is she so desperate?  It's tempting to make her a Hermione type: can't connect to peers because they're busy talking dolls when she's reading about nuclear fusion or Alice in Wonderland or whatever.  Can include a line about "finding friends in books"... leading up to an overly literal interpretation of same when she finds the grimoire.

Preceded by monologue/dialogue introducing protagonist's world.  (E.g. single child, trapped at home alone most of the time, parents distant.  Monologue can be spiked by failed attempts to get passing actors' attention.)

### Summoning

Follows pretty much directly from loneliness song.

Classic "witches' brew" song - fun and fluffy.  Good chance to include comedy and easter eggs (e.g. scary-sounding "magic words" that translate to [something silly](https://www.last.fm/music/Tool/_/Die+Eier+von+Satan/+wiki)).

Ends with devil appearing in stereotypical burst of smoke.

### Growing happiness

After the summoning is complete and the devil's contract has been made.

Upbeat song talking about how much better she feels now she has a friend - she's stronger now.  Ends with verse about how, now she's more confident, she's starting to find even more (human) friends.  Discordant sections in each verse (chorus?) when it talks about how helpful and supportive the devil has been... highlighting the ways in which he's really really not.  (C.f. gaslighting.)

Followed by a section introducing her four (?) new friends - three acquaintances and a bestie - whilst the devil looks on furiously in the background.

### Devil scheming

Classic villainous monologue.  (C.f. [Be Prepared](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPUe7O3ODHQ), [A Story Told](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_0eoWZO1OQ), etc etc.)

The devil is furious that the protagonist is starting to develop other friendships ("How dare she? *I* made her who she is!" - c.f. [All I Ask Of You](http://www.songlyrics.com/phantom-of-the-opera/all-i-ask-of-you-reprise-lyrics/)), and plans to take extreme action (killing off the friends) so that she can't escape his devilish schemes.

Maybe have him throw out ideas of terrible fates he can inflict (c.f. [Kidnap the Sandy Claws](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry7PcYtKPhA)), and generally sound very smug about his cunning plots.

### Growing fear

The protagonist's human friends have been going missing... and she wonders if she is the cause.  Or, more specifically, her devil friend, who has been in a funny mood lately (or completely AWOL?).  This song is where the bubble bursts on her previous state of denial, as she dramatically stumbles across corpse after corpse, in cupboards and fridges (heh) and other nooks.

By the end of the song, only her bestie is left.  Once she explains the situation, they vow to exorcise this monster.

### Exorcism

A dark mirror of the summoning song, emphasising her determination to make things right.

Ends with the devil being dragged back into the summoning circle... but before he's banished he has his own verse (or freeform speech?) wherein he exploits the contract wording to extract a terrible price.

My suggestion for the price: he drags her friend back to hell with him.  However, see Author's Notes for discussion.

Repeated refrain:

- I brought him here from hell
- He's made my life a hell
- We'll send him back to hell
- I'll drag her (the friend) down to hell

### Reprise

At this point, the protagonist is in shock: her victory has turned out to be very much of the Pyrrhic variety.  The reprise, rounding off the play, can call back to different themes as she works through her emotions.

If going the "friend dragged to hell" route, this would mean:

1. Loneliness.  Her friends have been killed, stolen away or banished; she's back where she started.
1. Growing happiness.  She's stronger now... but, in the discordant sections, she wonders if she can leave it at that.
1. Scheming.  Her friend was taken and she wonders if she can save her... or at least get revenge on the devil.  Surely she can plot out a way?
1. Determination (per exorcism).  She *will* do this: save her friend and truly make her life her own again.  A hero is born.

It would be a Crowning Moment of Awesome if the reprise could borrow the melodies from each section and weave them into a semi-coherent whole (c.f. [La Resistance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LonKGuS9uuQ), the climactic medley in South Park: The Movie).

After this: curtains fall, play ends.

## Author's notes

### Devil's deal and aftermath

The biggest hole in the synopsis is how the story ends.  The devil's banishing must carry some kind of cost, or it will make the tension leading up to it look a bit too artificial.

This question of cost ties into the *other* big hole: what were the terms of the original deal?

One idea I've recently had: if the original deal were for the devil to be "her leading friend, with all others following behind"... this would be a justification for him to drag one of her human friends (last living one?) into hell with him at the end of the exorcism scene.  ~Hell~ Heck of a price there.

I like this outcome because it would set the scene for a spine-tingling reprise: first noting her reinstated loneliness (with associated melody from song #1); then the fact that she is now free to seek happiness (with song #3); but instead she starts wondering if she can save her lost friend (song #4); and ending on a note of rising determination to invade hell and "bring her (friend) back from hell" (per song #6).

My friend, on the other hand, feels that this would leave things a bit too open-ended.  This is further evidence that I'm utter crap at bringing stories to a close.  Further thought needed.
