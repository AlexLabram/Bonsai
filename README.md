As of late 2021, I'm trying to get more into the habit of writing fiction, and helping a friend of mine get over her phobia of world-building.

Folder structure:

- [World-building concepts](wb/)
- [My original writings](orig/) - currently very limited!
- [Dungeons & Dragons character concepts](dnd/) - yes, I'm a nerd, live with it
- [Joint projects](peer/) - currently there's a lot of overlap with the "world-building" section, but whatevs
