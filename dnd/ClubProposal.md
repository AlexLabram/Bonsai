# Proposed Tea House Theatre Gaming Club

The below is a "straw-man" proposal only: it's intended to be explicit enough that people can usefully argue against it, not to be correct or final.  If I've said something blatantly moronic, don't take it personally; just tell me and I'll fix it.

Corrections to Alex via WhatsApp or phone (number ending 952).  Or just push a git update, if you're tech-savvy.

## Goals
+ Play games in a pleasant ocation
+ Socialise and meet new people
+ Keep the THT ticking over, both financially and practically

## Schedule
Sundays of each month, 7pm til late:
+ 1 & 3: Invite-only D&D session
+ 2 & 4: Open "play til late" gaming session: one-shot roleplaying, board games, classic games
+ 5 (e.g. 30 April): D&D GM workshop and worldbuilding

Starting from Feb 2022, since January is a mess for many of us and our organising will need some prep time.

## Location
+ Main: Tea House Theatre
+ Backup: Alex L's flat (seats 8 people comfortably / 12 at a pinch; 5 mins walk from THT)
  - Thomas' flat is directly above mine and may offer a partial backup-of-back-up if he's willing

## Entry fees
+ Free for THT off-duty staff (and owners)
+ Open sessions: £5 basic, £10 with drink coupon
  - Conditions: use only on day of receipt; no spirits or large bottles/pitchers (I *think* this covers everything costing more than £10?)
  - My logic here is that, even if someone grabs a £9.50 pot of tea with their coupon, they've effectively paid for their seat.
+ Closed sessions: no entry fee, but alcohol must either be bought from THT or have corkage paid (£5 per wine bottle / beer pack)
  - I really can't see this becoming a huge issue since these sessions are invite-only, but good to be explicit

## Open session rules
+ Bring your own games, but be willing to play other people's
+ Usual THT rules
  - No bringing alcohol (without paying corkage)
  - No harassing the waitresses
  - Anyone being an asshole can be asked to leave
+ Hospitality volunteers (see below) can also give people the boot
+ The GM of a single-shot campaign has discretion about their table and may e.g. set timers for actions or ask people to stop discussing.
+ By default, the owner of a board game is treated as the GM for that game.
+ Regarding board games: you break it, you bought it.  This includes losing pieces. 

## Administrative needs
+ Posters / graphics
  - Who does this for the THT?  Ilyana?
+ Entry fee collection
  - This should be a lot more straightforward if we're not trying to run a D&D session at the same time people are arriving!
  - Is this something we could run through the THT till?
+ Staff support
  - Do we need to ensure that there are wait staff on duty, or can Harry/Freddie run the counter for us in between game rounds?
+ Hospitality
  - Someone needs to be designated greeter / socialiser. On a good day I'll be happy to do this; if my depression has kicked in then I'll need backup.
  - Waive £5 entry fee for volunteers willing to do hospitality and help clear up afterwards?
+ Mailing list
  - Meetup.com [costs £14.99/month](https://techboomers.com/t/when-is-meetup-free-how-much-it-costs) for group organisers
  - We may also be able to partner with an existing gaming group - research needed!
    - E.g. [these guys](https://www.meetup.com/south-london-Board-Games/)
    - Note that Meetup's localisation is utterly rubbish - it can't quite grasp the concept of a city more than 5 miles across, thus "south London" is an oxymoron...
    - In addition, there will be stuff on Facebook.  However, I'm on a No-Facebook social media diet, so someone else will need to go digging!
  - Failing that, I (Alex) would be happy to cover the fees for the first six months, on the understanding that I'd be reimbursed the £90 if/when this became a going concern
    - "Going concern" to be defined if/when this becomes relevant, but in such a way as to ensure the THT makes a healthy profit!
  - It would probably be worth running a couple of open sessions without social media advertising to test the water before we risk triggering a stampede

## Open questions
+ To what extent is Harry I going to be up for this?
+ Who do I need to speak to to get this entered into THT brochures, Penny Post, etc
+ Who do I need to speak to to produce / agree some "cover art"
+ How can we avoid displacing the current social group (Dean, Mandi et al)
  - Incidentally, is his name spelled Mandy, Mandeep, or what?  It's been bugging me.
+ What does our shortlist of potential volunteers look like?
+ What am I missing on the admin front?
+ Will Harry I ever be willing to set up WhatsApp on his "new" phone?  :-P
