# Roll With It: a proposal for a Tea House Theatre Gaming Club

## Intro

We've been running the weekly D&D sessions for a while now.  It's great fun, but it's not meeting all of our gaming needs and it would be nice to take things up a gear.

Corrections and additions to Alex via WhatsApp or phone (number ending 952).  Or just push a git update, if you're tech-savvy.

## Strategy

### Goals

1. Let us play interesting games in a pleasant location
1. Let us socialise, meet new people and gradually expand the core group
1. Help keep the THT ticking over, both financially and practically
1. Support "blue-sky" gaming ideas that rely on an established group

### Sales funnel

We can break players down by whether they are primarily interested in gaming from a strategy perspective (e.g. me) or theatrics perspective (e.g. Ed).  Then by how intellectually stimulating they like their gaming, as follows:

| Level | Strategy gaming                          | Dramatic gaming                          |
|:-----:|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Casual: draughts, basic chess            | -                                        |
| 2     | Complex: chess, Monopoly                 | Single-shot: Paranoia, Mothership        |
| 3     | Sophisticated: Dune, Settlers of Catan   | Long-term: D&D / Pathfinder              |
| 4     | Game development and play-testing        | "Performative role-playing"              |

Our current gaming sessions are mainly aimed at level #3: sophisticated gamers who are willing to take the time to properly engage with the game.  However, people like that don't usually spring out of nowhere.  And, since we occasionally lose players - e.g. to chronic depression (_guilty cough_) - we're doomed to eventually fall below what's required to run a game.  Even if that never happens, playing with the same six people eventually loses its thrill.

We therefore need a way of getting people involed at lower levels, then steadily filtering out the dross and brainwashing the good 'uns into joining us.  (Just like any good cult, really.)  My proposed solution is to set up a separate casual gaming evening focusing on levels #1 and #2: primarily conventional board games, with the occasional one-off roleplaying session running quietly (!) in a corner.

We can then cherry-pick the people who are (a) fun to be around and (b) interested in games requiring more time and attention, and use them to grow our core group organically.  In an ideal world we'd be able to get two or three separate D&D campaigns running at a time, which would give us all a lot more flexibility.  Is your character's role in Game A currently limited to saying "are we nearly there yet"?  Go play an NPC in Game B until you're needed.  Game B not floating your boat either?  Grab another bystander for a quick game of [Onitama](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/160477/onitama) or [Akamen](https://github.com/AlexLabram/CreativeWriting/blob/main/orig/Endgame.md).

It has also been suggested that, if we get enough core gamers, we can start doing even cleverer stuff (level #4) that really needs to draw from a decent-sized population.  This is currently blue-sky thinking, to be revisited in a few months.

### Covid

At time of writing, Covid is currently on a [dramatic up-tick](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/) in the UK.  Worst case, we may need to put everything face-to-face on hold, and I don't think there's a lot of appetite for trying to run something like this online.

Even if things stay open, a gaming event - where people keep chatting and swapping tables in an enclosed space - is up there with Competitive Tongue Wrestling in the canon of epidemiologically unwise ideas.  So we may need to require mask-wearing or similar.  However, this is something that can be discussed closer to the time if it looks like we're going ahead.

### Finance

I personally wouldn't bother to run something like this for the money; anything I do regarding games is primarily for personal enjoyment / development.  However, I'm aware that not everyone has this luxury.  We will need to consider whether / to what extent money should be involved, and to whom it should flow.

My understanding is that Harry I has normally been against the Tea House Theatre charging for events like this, on the basis that you catch more flies with honey... ah, I mean that the THT should feel like our home away from home and we should want to keep going back there ~~and buying lots of tea~~.  If my understanding is incorrect, and the THT would want to receive a share of any income, please let me know.

I'm (now) aware that some GMs actually get paid for this stuff, which makes sense given the amount of preparation involved.  However, I wouldn't want this to become a barrier to entry, either for new potential players (who are unlikely to remortgage their house to test out this weirdo "Dee Un Dee" thing) or for wannabe GMs (I know _my_ initial GMing attempts wouldn't be worth a bent nickel).  I also wouldn't be comfortable essentially running a small business in my spare time: that sort of thing has _implications_ where I work, and none of us need the associated paperwork.

Some advertising channels (esp. Meetup.com) charge organisers fees.  In the short term most of these can be worked round (if only by ignoring the channel in question), but in the long run we may see value in taking gamers' money to fund this kind of membership-boosting activity.  If it worked for Ponzi...

We may also wish to charge / raise fees if we find we're too massively over-subscribed.  This is one of those situations where overperforming can be almost as dangerous as underperforming, e.g. if short-term booms drive off long-term members.  However, I'd say that this is not an immediate concern.

### Leadership succession

In an ideal world, I'll be able to help kick this thing off then hand over operation to another volunteer.  I'm doing a lot better with my depression than last year, but I still don't want to make any large commitments more than a few months ahead if I can avoid it, for fear of another slump.

Ed has expressed some interest in supporting this, especially from a dramatic games perspective.  Any other ~~victims~~ volunteers, let me know.

## Draft plan of action

In business jargon, this is what's called a [straw man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man_proposal) proposal: it's intended to be explicit enough that people can usefully argue against it, _not_ to be correct or final.  Basically, if I've said something blatantly moronic, don't take it personally; just tell me and I'll fix it.

### Schedule
Sundays of each month, 7pm til late:
+ 1 & 3: Invite-only D&D session
+ 2 & 4: Open "play til late" gaming session: one-shot roleplaying, board games, classic games
+ 5 (e.g. 30 April, 30 July, 29 Oct): D&D GM knowledge sharing, worldbuilding and grousing about players

Starting from Feb 2022, since January is a mess for many of us and our organising will need some prep time.

The suggestion for the "fifth sundays" is more of a placeholder: I'd like us to do _something_ non-routine and forward-looking rather than just extending the normal sessions to cover these days.

### Location
+ Main: Tea House Theatre
+ Backup: Alex L's flat (seats 8 people comfortably / 12 at a pinch; 5 mins walk from THT)
  - Thomas' flat is directly above mine and may offer a partial backup-of-back-up if he's willing

### Fees
Old plan:
+ Free for THT off-duty staff (and owners)
+ Open sessions: £5 basic, £10 with drink coupon
  - Conditions: use only on day of receipt; no spirits or large bottles/pitchers (I *think* this covers everything costing more than £10?)
  - My logic here is that, even if someone grabs a £9.50 pot of tea with their coupon, they've effectively paid for their seat.
+ Closed sessions: no entry fee, but alcohol must either be bought from THT or have corkage paid (£5 per wine bottle / beer pack)
  - I really can't see this becoming a huge issue since these sessions are invite-only, but good to be explicit

New plan:
+ Open sessions: No entry fee; GMs running one-shot sessions can charge a table fee of up to £5 for players (but not spectators)
  - We'll probably want to stick any such role-players in one of the curtained-off areas to stop them scaring off the rest of the club.
+ Closed sessions: no entry fee, but alcohol must either be bought from THT or have corkage paid (£5 per wine bottle / beer pack)

The new plan is based on discussion with Ed, who was in favour of more money flowing towards the GMs. This is partially because he's a GM but also because it'll draw in more talent on the acting side.

### Open session rules
+ Bring your own games, but be willing to play other people's
+ Usual THT rules
  - No bringing alcohol (without paying corkage)
  - No harassing the waitresses
  - Anyone being an asshole can be asked to leave
+ Hospitality volunteers (see below) can also give people the boot
+ The GM of a single-shot campaign has discretion about their table and may e.g. set timers for actions, ask people to stop discussing, or break out the squirt bottle.
+ By default, the owner of a board game is treated as the GM for that game.
+ Regarding board games: you break it, you bought it.  This includes losing pieces. 

For roleplaying games, where personal isssues tend to get more exaggerated, a basic social contract - some "how not to be a dickhead to your fellow attendees" rules, plus a listing of content warnings for a given game - will be printed and stuck to the table.  No-one can say they weren't warned.

In the short term (first 2 months), we'll limit the running of single-shot roleplaying games to people in the core group (e.g. Ed and Other Harry).  In the medium/long term we may open this out to carefully-vetted third parties.

### Administrative needs
+ Posters / graphics
  - Who does this for the THT?  Ilyana?
+ Entry fee collection
  - This should be a lot more straightforward if we're not trying to run a D&D session at the same time people are arriving!
  - Is this something we could run through the THT till?
+ Staff support
  - Do we need to ensure that there are wait staff on duty, or can Harry/Freddie run the counter for us in between game rounds?
+ Hospitality
  - Someone needs to be designated greeter / socialiser. On a good day I'll be happy to do this; if my depression has kicked in then I'll need backup.
  - Waive £5 entry fee for volunteers willing to do hospitality and help clear up afterwards?
+ Mailing list
  - Meetup.com [costs £14.99/month](https://techboomers.com/t/when-is-meetup-free-how-much-it-costs) for group organisers
  - We may also be able to partner with an existing gaming group - research needed!
    - E.g. [these guys](https://www.meetup.com/south-london-Board-Games/)
    - Note that Meetup's localisation is utterly rubbish - it can't quite grasp the concept of a city more than 5 miles across, thus "south London" is an oxymoron...
    - In addition, there will be stuff on Facebook.  However, I'm on a No-Facebook social media diet, so someone else will need to go digging!
  - Failing that, I (Alex) would be happy to cover the fees for the first six months, on the understanding that I'd be reimbursed the £90 if/when this became a going concern
    - "Going concern" to be defined if/when this becomes relevant, but in such a way as to ensure the THT makes a healthy profit!
  - It would probably be worth running a couple of open sessions without social media advertising to test the water before we risk triggering a stampede

## Open questions
+ To what extent is Harry I going to be up for this?
+ Who do I need to speak to to get this entered into THT brochures, Penny Post, etc
+ Who do I need to speak to to produce / agree some "cover art"
+ How can we avoid displacing the current social group (Dean, Mandi et al)
  - Incidentally, is his name spelled Mandy, Mandeep, or what?  It's been bugging me.
+ What does our shortlist of potential volunteers look like?
+ What am I missing on the admin front?
+ Will Harry I ever be willing to set up WhatsApp on his "new" phone?  :-P
