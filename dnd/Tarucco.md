# My character

## Key points

+ Chaotic evil half-elf anti-paladin
+ Hates "plane-traitors" - cultists and churchgoers alike
+ Formerly of the Tunderblitzen elves (basically elvish neo-nazis) 
+ TL;DR: "Rampaging, dubiously-sane meatshield with a grudge against all things godly"

## Player motivation

I've been an atheist since before I could pronounce the word[^1], but my subtype is the mundane skeptical atheist.  (C.f. the quote ascribed to Laplace: "I had no need of that hypothesis".)  Occasionally, though, I meet religious people who assume I must be the fiery "strangle the last king with the entrails of the last priest" Anton LaVey-style antitheist.  And... well, frankly it sounds a lot more fun to be that sort of atheist.

Thus this D&D character.  Operating as he does in a world where gods are known to exist by authorial fiat, and where some of them are demonstrably utter *assholes*, he is a perfect excuse to let my inner Nietzsche out to play.

[^1]: If I'd started reading that children's encyclopedia from the other end, I'd be a Zoroastrian today...

## Origin story

Tarucco was born in a Tunderblitz army camp: his father was a Unitarum (NCO) in the Kriegskampfkraft, and his mother was a human Untertan enslaved in an Unterwerfung (conquest of submission).  Shortly after the birth of their half-elf bastard son, his mother was put down by the Zeal Zeiler (religious commissars) for the crime of polluting the noble elven bloodline.  His father was demoted to Unitia and was put on the front line as cannon fodder.  Tarucco's life didn't really improve much from there...

The newly-orphaned child survived as a luggage boy and general dogsbody for the Tunderblitzen Krieg Corps.  Unexpectedly, despite the disdain of both adult soldiers and other orphans for the Halbblut Verunreinigt, he thrived in this environment, quickly finding his new home amongst the scrolls and books of the religious commissariat.  Lacking any friends or playmates - and thus any distractions - he quickly learned to read the elvish script and began secluding himself with the community's religious texts and historical documents for days on end.

The texts gave him something he had never felt before: a sense of community and acceptance.  He developed an unshakeable belief that, despite his sordid origins, the Tunderblitzen divine pantheon - the Dämpfer Eichenholz (Lightning-Struck Tree), and the True Gods of which it is the harbinger - had a plan for him too.  Thus, when he reached the age of military service, he sought to join the military himself and, after much effort to prove himself, was provisionally accepted on the explicit condition that he serve and guard the pure Alfblut around him with his life... and stay out of sight as much as possible.  Whilst he found the recruiting sergeant's prejudice against a fellow Zealot of the True Gods distasteful, he accepted it as the price of doing business with the less spiritually-literate lower ranks.

Over the following four years of service in the Jäger (irregular skirmishers and occasional penal legion) he weathered scorn, segregation and sabotage to become one of the most promising young fighters of his generation, never losing his Zeal to better serve the Tree.  He completed dangerous mission after dangerous mission, slaughtering battle-hungry greenskins, insidious cultists and decadent humans alike in defence of his people, and gained a reputation for blocking attacks on his fellow Jäger - no matter how contemptuous they were of the mongrel in their midst - with his strong half-human body.

Unfortunately this splendid showing attracted the wrong sort of attention.  The Kommandant of the regiment to which his squad was attached, incensed that a half-breed was gaining glory at the expense of *proper* elves, began to assign him dangerous task after dangerous task.  Tarucco survived the onslaught through skill and subterfuge, but eventually was ordered on a true suicide mission: to singlehandedly slow down the advance of a hundred-strong human mercenary squadron for as long as there was breath in his body.

Despairing, he sought guidance from the Gods: on the night before his mission, he infiltrated the Vale of the Lightning-Struck Tree deep within the Elven capital of Bergtal.  (Author's note: Ed mentioned that this probably justifies me getting +2 to climbing, since the Vale is a bugger to get into - discuss later.)  Seeing a class of paladin candidates waiting to receive the Tree's blessing - in the form of a thunderstorm that had been predicted to arrive that evening - he hid until late at night when the Alfblut had left in disappointment.  Then, kneeling before the Tree, he desperately begged to be shown a sign.

Apparently whichever diviner was responsible for predicting the storm had forgotten to carry the 1, because the thunder began as Tarucco knelt there in the rain.  Drenched in sweat and still clad in metal armour, his prone form was soon struck by an errant bolt of lightning, instantly forging a holy connection between him and the Tree.  He had received a sign, a recognition of his indomitable faith, and been given the chance to receive the wisdom of his Gods directly.

The spirit of the Tree looked into his heart, saw his devotion and history of hard service, noted the resilience of his beliefs in the face of years of bigotry... and told him bluntly that his duty was to follow orders, proceed with his mission, and "give his life for his betters".  When the distraught half-elf asked if he might at least hope for his spirit to join the ranks of his Alfblut ancestors and live on as part of the Tree's divinity, its harsh response of "don't be ridiculous" finally broke his heart and his faith.

No-one knows precisely what happened after that, but by the time the sun rose the mercenary force had been butchered to a man, and Tarucco's nascent connection to the Tree had been brutally severed.  The fallen paladin staggered back to the Corps camp in the morning, his battered armour still dripping red with the invaders' blood.  There he learned that, in his brief absence, the Kommandant had declared him a deserter and sentenced the half-elf to death in absentia... clearly not having expected him to survive long enough to contest this falsehood.  With that last betrayal, Tarucco embraced his nature as an outcast, a blackguard, an *antipaladin*.  "For it is better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven"...

In his anger at the Kommandant's betrayal, he succeeded in killing a dozen Jäger and several Zeilen before finally being driven off by archers.  Returning to the battlefield, he covered his hard worn armour with spikes harvested from the peaked helmets of the dead mercenaries, scavenged what loot he could from the corpses, and made off for human lands.

## Beliefs

Having been disabused of his faith in the benevolence of the Tunderblitzen religion - at least as it applies to himself - Tarucco now views the society that 
tormented him for so long not as a perversion of the Gods' divine vision but as a fish that has rotted from the head.  He has extended his prior loathing of demon-summoners and cultists to cover all worshippers and churchgoers, viewing them as traitors to their plane and puppets dancing to the gods' evil designs.

He secretly hates his younger self for the years wasted in study and self-denial, and has sworn to experience the full range of earthly pleasures that he had previously renounced.  In contrast to his scholarly upbringing, he struggles to focus on long-term plans and goals as his mind inevitably drifts to past failures.  Only blood truly quenches his rage and permits him to think clearly.

He now views the ethical precepts he worked so hard to learn as mere window-dressing: a way for those in power to maximise their subjects' productivity and neuter any threat they might pose.  He desires to one day be strong and subtle enough to similarly rise above the laws of gods and men.

Tarucco enjoys bloodying his scimitar in combat but will flee shamelessly once a fight stops being entertaining and starts to present a genuine threat to his health.  He will happily stab strangers in the back but, despite his nihilistic creed, he has proven strangely reluctant to extend that level of violence to those he has fought beside, even if they are only allies of convenience (he considers no-one a true friend).  He detests being betrayed or cheated and tends to respond with violence.

Lightning-struck trees are sacred to the Tunderblitzen elves, and Tarucco will thus seek to destroy them out of spite wherever he finds them.

## Current activities

Seeking employment in Ciedel after spending all his money on "interesting experiences" of the most unsavoury kind, Tarucco has found himself working on contract for the monks of Cicadel, a (secular) order who - amongst other responsibilities - seek to repel demonic incursions.  Despite being the farthest thing from a monk, he has found common cause with them in eliminating extraplanar entities and their "plane-traitor" followers.

The monks view him as a bloodthirsty blunt instrument who is likely to cause more harm than good in all but the most gruesome situations.  However, they concede his effectiveness at coming *back* from those situations with a smile on his face and some new spikes for his armour.  A faction within the Cicadelian order is actively attempting to get him killed by understating the danger level of his missions, but this is not (yet) an official policy and he frankly is so used to superiors who try to get him killed that he hasn't even noticed.

Somewhere around this point, the Ewoks rescued Gandalf from Never Never Land with the help of a dinosaur.  (Thanks to Harry 2 for providing a suitable [brown M&M test](https://blog.nuclino.com/brown-m-ms-or-why-no-one-s-reading-the-manual) for whether anyone actually reads this backstory!  Let me know if you read this far.)

His latest mission was to investigate weird phenomena at Bathurst Manor, an old building a long way east of Ciedel (and just south-west of Piedel).  This task quickly went off the rails in a rather amusing fashion involving undead monsters, pocket dimensions and animate rivers of blood - basically Tarucco's idea of a good time.  In the aftermath, he somehow found himself working with a party of adventurers to defend a village of human civilians from an orcish incursion.  He has so far found it both convenient and lucrative to stay with this group, although he has several solo escape routes marked out for if the situation becomes untenable and/or unduly boring.

Following the sudden gory death of an NPC called Mouthy Mary - an elderly woman who had rather impressed Tarucco by standing up to his oversized, heavily-spiked self when he tried to intimidate her - at the hands of an extraplanar shadow monster, he is currently extra homicidal.  He activated his Touch of Nihilism ability for the first time in a rage (see special rules below), and is now looking for an extraplanar entity down whose throat he can shove it.

...In *completely unrelated* news, he has just discovered that his erstwhile team-mate Abel is a literal angel in disguise.  He's not feeling at all betrayed over this, honest.  The red glowing eyes are just conjunctivitis.

## Special rules

(Author's note: these rules are under discussion and subject to change.)

Tarucco is not a classical anti-paladin as much as he is an *a*paladin: he loathes both "good" and "evil" extraplanar entities equally, regardless of what pretentious names they call themselves, as well as those tainted by them.  As such, I've agreed with Ed to tweak his (anti)paladin special abilities slightly, as follows:

+ [Detect Good](https://www.aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Detect%20Good) / [Detect Evil](https://www.aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Detect%20Evil) is replaced by Detect Extraplanar
  - This strongly detects extraplanars such as angels or demons, and weakly detects their followers.
+ [Smite Good](https://www.aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Paladin) / [Smite Evil](https://www.aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Antipaladin)  is replaced by Smite Extraplanar 
  - This strongly buffs attacks against extraplanars such as angels or demons, and weakly buffs attacks against their followers.
  - Damage bonus: 2 points per level against extraplanars; 75% for possessed; 50% for channeler e.g. cleric with divine spells; 25% for follower; round up to nearest whole.
  - So at my current Anti-Paladin Level 2: 4pts vs extraplanar, 3pts vs possessed, 2pts vs channelers, 1pt vs Jehovah's Witnesses.
+ [Aura of Evil](https://www.aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Antipaladin) / [Aura of Good](https://www.aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Paladin) is replaced by Aura of Nihilism
  - This attracts aggro from both good and evil extraplanars and their followers.
  - The spells Detect Good and Detect Evil both return positive results if cast on Tarucco by an extraplanar, or one power level lower if cast by a follower.
  - The special abilities Smite Good and Smite Evil both affect Tarucco at full strength if cast by an extraplanar, or 50% strength if cast by a channeler (cleric or paladin).
+ [Touch of Corruption](https://www.aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Antipaladin) / [Lay On Hands](https://www.aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Paladin) is replaced by Touch of Nihilism
  - This hurts extraplanars and their followers, and heals those with no recorded loyalties outside Tarucco's home plane
  - Visually: it's a black flame
  - Damage scaling is per Smite Extraplanar - i.e. at AP level 2 this is 1d6 for true extraplanars, ⌈(1d6)x0.75⌉ for possessed, etc. <!-- symbols should be rounding-up brackets -->

The following do *not* count as extraplanars unless they are specifically noted as originating off-world:

+ Dragons
+ Undead

# House rules and rulings

## Experience

XP is given out at the start of each session, based on the coolest shit that we can remember (or bluff the DM into believing really happened) from the previous session.  There is a separate competition for the best and second-best stories; the best gives the winner the ability to auto-win a roll, the second-best gives a coin-toss chance at same (coin = D2 die!).  You may not use the same story for XP, D2 or "D1" stories.


# Notes on setting

Accululated from Ed's comments before I forget everything.

## Geography

+ The area we're involved with has sea to the south and west, and mountains to the north and east
+ The Mouth: a gap between the two mountain ranges
  - This is where the current campaign is happening
+ Ciedel: a city built against the first mountain *west* of the Mouth
  - Cicadel monastery: above Ciedel on the mountain
+ Piedel: a city built against the first mountain *east* of the Mouth
  - Picadel monastery: above Piedel on the mountain
  - ...Or at least I *think* I've finally got the right way round
  - The Shackle & Chain tavern is in a village near Piedel (I don't *think* that backwater was Piedel itself?)
    - Or at least it was until we killed the owner and best customer and set it on fire (three separate incidents!)
+ The Midlands: the open area between sea and Mouth
+ The Eaves: a series of settlements at the foot of the eastern mountain range
+ Dinium: a big port city on the south coast
+ The Great Plains: north of the Mouth
+ Random villages near Piedel: Middlemott, Hicup, Junty, Yutup, Hidwell, Redwas, Poise, Wartwas

No desert or Antarctic ice, but pretty much every other form of terrain can be found *somewhere* in the area

### Scale

The distance from Dinium to Piedel is comparable to the distance between El Paso (Texas) and Buffalo (New York) - i.e. c. 2,000 miles / 3,200 km.  By DM fiat, this is estimated as 30 days hard march (if anyone was actually able to keep the pace up that long), which at 4mph (standard forced-march speed) works out to a 17-hour day.  ...Yeah, that's not happening IRL any time soon.

(For comparison, the Emperor Hadrian once toured his entire empire on foot, marching 21 roman miles a day (19 English miles) in full armour.  It would have taken him slightly over 100 days to march the same distance.)

### Map

[img]Ed's world map (rough).jpg[/img]

## Tech level

Low fantasy: lots of magic, no gunpowder (despite our alchemist's best efforts to make things blow up!).

## Factions

The world is racially divided.  The only *routine* mixing of races occurs in Dinium, although most places are accustomed to travellers of other races.

+ Humans
  - Most of the Midlands are notionally human, I think
  - No real centralised government; more like a bunch of loosely-connected city-states, with smaller villages largely left to fend for themselves
+ Dwarves: not yet seen in this campaign; apparently the Tunderblitzen enslave some of them
+ Greenskins
  - Subspecies: orcs, half-orcs, ???
  - Come from the Great Plains in raiding parties
  - Use bloody great big dino-rhino animals as siege weapons; can't remember their names
  - Half-orcs used as scouts and infiltrators: they can "prove themselves" to a tribe by taking high-risk missions
+ Elves
  - Sub-faction: the Tunderblitz
  - Sub-faction: Sulbearn
+ Religious groups
  - Cicadel monastery
  - Picadel monastery

## General history

+ Huge war in human lands about 400 years ago; the infrastructure still hasn't recovered.  Lots of abandoned locations and lost relics from that time
+ Elven factions split a while back (when?), before which they "lived at one with the mountains and the valleys and nature"

## The Tunderblitz

+ Arose from a schism in elf society, with the other (less elven-supremacist?) side becoming the Sulbearn elves
+ The TB empire is in the mountains to the west of Cicadel monastery
+ Due to the terrain, their "capital" of Bergtal is more an archipelago of fortresses and mines, plus the Tree, all on the same mountain.  The archipelago is spread across their territory for similar reasons.
+ A lot of their fortresses are either "repurposed" Dwarven holdfasts or built with dwarven slave labour

### Religion

Theology

+ Tunderblitzen religion is [premillennialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premillennialism): the Lightning-Struck Tree (Dämpfer Eichenholz) is a harbinger of some kind for the True Gods who will eventually arrive and elevate the Tunderblitzen above all others.
+ Its [soteriology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soteriology) is ethno-nationalist: both non-elves (regardless of their actions) and non-worshippers (regardless of their species) are on the proverbial naughty list.
+ In death, Tunderblitzen elves' spirits are woven into the Tree's own; this is mirrored by their burial rites which involve cremation and sowing of ashes at the foot of the Tree.
  - I'm reminded of Warhammer 40K Eldar's use of "infinity circuits" (ship-wide communal soul jars) to build up sufficient spiritual charge that a [new god](https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Ynnead) can be born from them.

In society

+ Tunderblitz society is totalitarian: religious beliefs are firmly intertwined with mortal power structures.  In particular, the army includes a large number of Zeal Zeiler (commissars) who function as clerics.
+ Whereas in human society paladins are trained in pseudo-monastic orders separately from the conventional military, the Tunderblitzen equivalent is merely a separate special rank within the armed forces; it's like noting that a soldier has medical training.  Particularly outstanding and devout soldiers are given the opportunity to commune with the Tree during a lightning storm, and those that successfully complete this "conversion course" receive a note on their files, a few subtle uniform changes, and a hefty boost to their chances of promotion.
+ Contra classic fantasy elves, they dislike most trees and only regard highly that have survived a lightning strike (especially oaks).  "And, when these trees have new life, they march to war"

### Military

Known ranks

+ Standard Tunderblitzen weaponry includes claymore swords

## Sulbearn elves

Not really discussed in depth; mostly we know that they're the nice(r) elves who got mostly wiped out when the Tunderblitz invaded their territory in the mountains just west of Cicadel.  A lot of them fled to Ciedel, where they... sit around under trees or something?  Tarucco doesn't really care enough to find out.

## Cross-factional religion

### Random prophecy

> A star fell from heaven, and it arose and ate and pastured amongst these oxen.  And after this I saw the large and the black oxen, and behold, all of them changed their pens and their pastures and their heifers, and began to moan, one after another.  And again I saw in the vision and looked to heaven, and behold, I saw many stars, how they came down and were thrown down from heaven to that first star, and amongst those heifers and bulls; they were with them, pasturing amongst them.  And I looked at them and saw, and behold, all of them let out their private parts like horses and began to mount the cows of the bulls, and they all became pregnant and bore elephants and camels and asses.  And all the oxen feared them and were affrighted at them, and began to bite with their teeth and to devour, and to gore with their horns.  And they began, moreover, to devour those oxen; and behold all the children of the earth began to tremble and quake before them and to flee from them.

Dafuq?
