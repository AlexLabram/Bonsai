## Player motivation

I've been an atheist since before I could pronounce the word, but my subtype is the mundane skeptical atheist.  (C.f. the quote ascribed to Laplace: "I had no need of that hypothesis".)  Occasionally, though, I meet religious people who assume I must be the fiery "strangle the last king with the entrails of the last priest" Anton LaVey-style antitheist.  And... well, frankly it sounds a lot more fun to be that sort of atheist.

Thus this D&D character.  Operating as he does in a world where gods are known to exist by authorial fiat, and where some of them are demonstrably utter *assholes*, he is a perfect excuse to let my inner Nietzsche out to play.

## Origin story

Tarucco was born into a tribe of Tunderblitzen elves: his father was a warrior of the tribe, and his mother was a human slave captured in a raid.  Shortly after the birth of their half-elf bastard son, his mother was put down by the tribal elders for the crime of polluting the noble elven bloodline and his father took a suicide mission to remove the stain on his family's honour.  Things didn't really improve from there.

The newly-orphaned child was given over to the priests of Findeladlara, whose shrine effectively doubled as the orphanage.  Unexpectedly, despite the disdain of both adult minders and other orphans, he thrived in this environment.  Lacking any friends or playmates - and thus any distractions - he quickly learned to read the elvish script and began secluding himself with the tribe's religious texts and historical documents for days on end.

The texts gave him something he had never felt before: a sense of community and acceptance.  He developed an unshakeable belief that, despite his sordid origins, the elven gods - Findelaldlara of the City, Yuelral of the Land and Ketephys of the Forest - cared for him too.  Thus, when he came of age to leave the orphanage, he demanded to join the ranks of the Knights of Yuelral.  Despite the best efforts of both priests and paladins to dissuade or deny him, he passed every test with flying colours and was quickly inducted as a paladin's squire.

Over the following four years of training and service he weathered scorn, segregation and sabotage to become one of the most promising young paladins of his generation, never losing his burning desire to better serve the gods.  He completed mission after mission, slaughtering battle-hungry greenskins, insidious cultists and decadent humans alike in defence of his people, and gained a reputation for blocking attacks on his fellow squires - no matter how contemptuous they were of the mongrel in their midst - with his strong half-human body.

Unfortunately this splendid showing attracted the wrong sort of attention.  The Master of the Order, incensed that a half-breed was gaining glory at the expense of *proper* elves, began to assign him dangerous task after dangerous task.  Tarucco survived the onslaught through skill and subterfuge, but eventually was ordered on a true suicide mission: to singlehandedly slow down the advance of a hundred-strong human mercenary squadron for as long as there was breath in his body.

Despairing, he prayed to the gods for aid, and was delighted and amazed when - for the first time in his life - they answered his calls for guidance.  Findeladlara herself spoke to him... and told him that his duty was to complete his mission and "give his life for his betters".  When the distraught half-elf asked if he might at least hope to see her realm in Elysium after his demise, her harsh response of "don't be ridiculous" finally broke his heart and his faith.

No-one knows precisely what happened that night, but in the morning the mercenary force had been butchered to a man, and Tarucco had lost the gods' blessing.  The fallen paladin staggered back to the nearest elven village in the morning, his battered armour still dripping red with the invaders' blood.  There he learned that, in his brief absence, the Master of the Order had declared him a forsworn runaway and sentenced the half-elf to death in absentia... clearly not having expected him to survive long enough to contest this falsehood.  With that last betrayal, Tarucco embraced his nature as an outcast, a blackguard, an *antipaladin*.  "For it is better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven"...

In his anger at the Master's betrayal, he succeeded in killing a dozen priests and several paladins before finally being driven off by archers.  Returning to the battlefield, he covered his hard worn armour with spikes harvested from the peaked helmets of the dead mercenaries, scavenged what loot he could from the corpses, and made off for human lands.

## Beliefs

Having been disabused of his faith in the benevolence of the elven gods, Tarucco now views the society that tormented him for so long not as a perversion of their vision but as a fish that has rotted from the head.  He has extended his prior loathing of demon-summoners and cultists to cover all worshippers and churchgoers, viewing them as traitors to their plane and puppets dancing to the gods' evil designs.

He secretly hates his younger self for the years wasted in study and self-denial, and has sworn to experience the full range of earthly pleasures that he had previously renounced.  In contrast to his scholarly upbringing, he struggles to focus on long-term plans and goals as his mind inevitably drifts to past failures.  Only blood truly quenches his rage and permits him to think clearly.

He now views the ethical precepts he worked so hard to learn as mere window-dressing: a way for those in power to maximise their subjects' productivity and neuter any threat they might pose.  He desires to one day be strong and subtle enough to similarly rise above the laws of gods and men.

Tarucco enjoys bloodying his scimitar in combat but will flee shamelessly once a fight stops being entertaining and starts to present a genuine threat to his health.  He will happily stab strangers in the back but, despite his nihilistic creed, he has proven strangely reluctant to extend that level of violence to those he has fought beside, even if they are only allies of convenience (he considers no-one a true friend).  He detests being betrayed or cheated and tends to respond with violence.

Lightning-struck trees are sacred to the Tunderblitzen elves, and Tarucco will thus seek to destroy them out of spite wherever he finds them.

## Current activities

Seeking employment in Picadel after spending all his money on "interesting experiences" of the most unsavoury kind, Tarucco has found himself working on contract for the monks of Picadel, a (secular) order who - amongst other responsibilities - seek to repel demonic incursions.  Despite being the farthest thing from a monk, he has found common cause with them in eliminating extraplanar entities and their "plane-traitor" followers.

The monks view him as a bloodthirsty blunt instrument who is likely to cause more harm than good in all but the most gruesome situations.  However, they concede his effectiveness at coming *back* from those situations with a smile on his face and some new spikes for his armour.  A faction within the Picadelian order is actively attempting to get him killed by understating the danger level of his missions, but this is not (yet) an official policy.

His latest mission was to investigate weird phenomena at a manor house just south-west of Cicadel.  This quickly went off the rails in a rather amusing fashion involving undead monsters, pocket dimensions and animate rivers of blood.  In the aftermath, he somehow found himself working with a party of adventurers to defend a village of human civilians from an orcish incursion.  He has so far found it both convenient and lucrative to stay with this group, although he has several solo escape routes marked out for if the situation becomes untenable.
