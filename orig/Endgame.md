# Endgame

## Notes

I went to a reading of The Great God Pan, one of the first cosmic horror books, on Hallowe'en 2020. This story kinda wrote itself afterwards.

Given the subject matter, that should probably worry me...

Ah, Arthur!  Come in, come in.  Mind the rug.  Can I get you anything to drink?

The invitation?  Ah yes, of course.  I suppose it may have seemed a bit cryptic, but I assure you the situation is quite straightforward.  You see, my collection of board games has gained a new member: a fascinating little puzzle I picked up in Japan.  But to get the most from it I needed a partner, and naturally I thought of you.

Yes, it's this one over here.  Note the delightful carrying case - I have a sneaking suspicion that it's an antique in its own right.  Aren't the carvings intriguing?  And the latch... see, you have to twist just *so*, and then squeeze, and the box unfurls like origami.  Beautiful design.

The game?  I understand it's called "Akamen", spelled with the kanji for "red mask".  Yes, it is a rather evocative name, isn't it?  I did wonder if the creator was a Poe fan, but the game seems to precede his work by quite some margin.

The rules were in Japanese, of course, but I've taken the liberty of typing up a translation - here, have a look through these print-outs.  I hope you don't mind if I keep talking while you read?  It's just such a delight to have someone to share all this with.  A new game... it makes me feel like I'm conquering a mountain summit, or pioneering across new lands, or meeting those strange wriggly things from the deep chasms of the ocean.  Brrrr...

Of course the old games - chess, draughts, backgammon - they still have their charm.  But they're just so thoroughly *solved* that it's hard to get excited about.  One feels like one is running a marathon only to find that one's more pragmatic competitors took a bus to the finish line.  Computers do rather change the picture.

Well, yes, I know I'm not telling *you* anything new here, Mister Professional Software Developer.  I must say, I couldn't do what you do; all that code makes my eyes go crossed.  Although I do have an interest in what one might call the narrative behind the software, especially when it has to do with our beloved games.

I was reading an article on this recently, actually.  You may recall that the board game Go is now considered a solved game?  Computers can beat any human hands-down; it's rather depressing really.  But how those computers go about their work is rather fascinating.

They play against themselves, you see.  A thousand games, a million, however many it takes.  And in each game they try a range of different options, a mix of exploring new moves and exploiting moves they've found work well.  But at the core of the process is what's called a "neural net", a sort of artificial hindbrain.  Flesh made idea, one might say.

...You've built one yourself?  In Excel?!  Better you than me, my friend.  But then you must be familiar with the mechanics of the situation.  Myself, I find I'm more interested in the *poetry* of the thing: a tangled skein of purest thought folded in on itself like a pearl nestling in the heart of this blunt machine, sifting through scenario after scenario until it knows in its bones how to play a beautiful game.

No, of course computers don't have bones.  I was being metaphorical.  I'm an artist, it's allowed.

Ah, shall we begin setting up the board then?  Yes, the tengu pieces go here, facing clockwise.  The magatama - comma shapes, to a plebeian like yourself - interlock in the centre as so.  And the rest flows outwards from that.  It's strangely obvious once you see it in action.

Going back to Go for a moment.  Those improvements I mentioned?  They're even more interesting because of how very distinct the game is to our Western games like chess.  I'm told that writing a chess program is simply a matter of brute force: one can explore every possible option a set number of moves ahead, looking for the path that leads to victory.  That's not possible with Go; there are just too many possible moves at any one time.

It's like the old Indian story about the sage who kept beating a king at chess - do you remember?  He asked to be rewarded with just one rice grain placed on the first square of the board.  Then two grains on the second square.  Then four on the third, eight on the fourth, sixteen grains on the fifth square... and by the time he reached the end of the chessboard the sage owned the kingdom.  Exponential growth run amok.

What this means, I'm told, is that the mindset required to play Go is *qualitatively* different from chess: you spend less time on brute-force extrapolation of moves and more time getting an intuitive gut feel for how you want the game to progress.  Less intelligence, more wisdom, one might say.  And for the longest time we thought that no computer could be wise enough to play both Go and chess.  Of course we were wrong.  I guess it's always risky to call something impossible.

I do wonder, though: if two games can codify two so different patterns of thought, what other mental motifs could you capture within a set of rules?  Rather than teaching us to be intelligent or wise, could you create a game that taught us to be happy?  Or sad?  Could you create a game that went beyond mortal modes of thought, and inculcated enlightenment into its players?  Or some deeper mystery, like Life or Love or even Death itself?

Oh, you may laugh.  But the things we know in our bones aren't limited to what we can fish for with our oh-so-limited intellectual nets.  Walk through a graveyard at three in the morning and call me a liar.

...That's not what you were laughing at?  In that case I completely agree with you: Monopoly is a perfect candidate for the "sad" game.

Now, let us play.  As your senpai in this game I shall take the opening move; my heron goes *here*... I twist the unagi by sixty degrees widdershins... and it's your turn.  Do take your time and think ahead a bit, we're in no rush.

While you ponder, I'll give you a bit of a potted history of the game.  It came to my attention about a month ago when I was visiting my university room-mate who now lives in Kyoto.  Did you ever meet Toshiro?  He's almost as big a board-game fanatic as you and me.

I was at his house when the request came through.  You see, a neighbour of his, a shopkeeper in his 70s, had died recently, and when his grandchildren arrived to divvy up his personal property they found the most magnificent collection of games.  I've never seen anything like it, I swear.  Board games, card games, tile games, a funny game involving clockwork... and of course the Akamen itself.

The elderly lady next door had suggested that Toshiro might be able to help with valuing the collection, and I invited myself along as a visiting expert.  Most of it was worthless, of course: used board games aren't exactly renowned for their resale value.  But laid out on a table in the middle of the room was this intricate wooden game set, and when I saw it I knew I *had* to have it.  Probably spent too much, to be honest, but everyone came away happy.

Anyway, the old lady was able to shed some light on where the Akamen set came from.  Apparently the previous owner had picked it up from a rather interesting chap: a Shinto priest who had been defrocked, or whatever the Japanese word is, for some kind of unspecified misbehaviour.  Unfortunately I didn't manage to get much more out of her; she actually passed away a few days later.  There was something of a cluster of deaths in that block - it seemed for a while like the old man had started a trend of sorts - but then it did always have a large elderly population.  Sad but not unexpected.

Ooh, good move there.  That bit where you swapped the two spider pieces around is actually mentioned in the rules - I believe it's called the Jigoku gambit.  If you worked it out yourself then you must be really getting into the game.  Can you feel its patterns inveigling their way into your neurons?

Hmmm, you're looking a bit pale there.  Are you sure you're OK to continue?  Good, good.

Where was I?  Ah, yes, the origins of the game.  I asked around about the ex-priest and apparently he'd been let go for stealing from the local temple.  Not money, no; antiquities from their vaults.  I didn't know Shinto temples had vaults, but I guess it makes sense.  Gotta keep the dangerous artifacts somewhere safe, right?

No, of course they wouldn't have anything really dangerous.  But you know how superstitious some people can be, and Shinto is at the more... folk-loric end of the Japanese religious spectrum.  They probably think they've got the King in Yellow, the Necronomicon and the blasted Lament Configuration locked up in there.

You haven't heard of...  Arthur, you philistine!  I'll have to lend you some books later.  Maybe an aspirin too - are you sure you're OK to carry on?  Right, I'll stop asking.

Now, if I steer my remaining shikigami piece over to the side here, and promote the oni to the centre, that's what they call the Black Lotus manoeuvre.  You see how it almost turns the game on its head?  It's quite hard to visualise what's going on here, but if you let the position percolate through your mind for a bit then you should find it clicks for you.

Anyway, going back to my story, it seems that the old man had only picked up the game a few days before I got to Tokyo.  The priest must have been pretty keen to get rid of it - we found a receipt in his room, only five hundred yen.  That's about five quid to you.

Then, a week later, the heart attack hit.  The old man was found sitting in his chair, with his pipe still hanging out of his mouth, face pale as snow, staring at a game board laid out on the table in front of him.  It's a shame, no doubt, but given the size of his collection I think it's the way he'd have wanted to go.

Which game?  Why, it was the Akamen of course.

Now I don't know about you, but that leaves me wondering: did the game itself have anything to do with the old man's demise?  Could the structure of the board, the rules, the pieces, have encoded some great and terrible mentality that pushed him over the edge?  Maybe he somehow looked beyond the limits of the human mind, and suffered for it.  "And when you gaze into the abyss..."

Of course, this is all just ridiculous speculation.  I've played the game a few times with Toshiro and I'm totally fine.  He's in excellent shape too: veritably flushed with health, the last time I laid eyes on him.  Not like his poor neighbours, all so pale in death.

But the idea that simply by playing the right series of gambits and manoeuvres one could cast one's mind out into the void, and maybe even *bring something back*... that I do find fascinating.  There are so many myths and legends about the incomprehensible worlds that lie beyond, just waiting for a witness who isn't limited by mere human cognition.  Surely any price would be worth paying, any hunger worth feeding, to gaze on those impossible vistas of the soul.

Don't you agree, Arthur?

Arthur?

Ah, I see from your rather... fixed expression that you've understood me perfectly.  I do appreciate an *attentive* audience.  Just let me take that coffee cup from your hand before you drop it.  We don’t want to make a mess, now, do we?

And now, yes, let me move this one last piece...

...Why, I do believe that's my game.
