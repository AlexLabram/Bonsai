...Or at least those I've managed to dig out of whatever closet they were stuffed in, and that aren't already associated with a pseudonym that I'd prefer to keep distinct from my professional identity.

## Ideas

(See Worldbuilding for ideas that are less plot-focused.)

- "Hard superhero" setting (per Worm) where people on a modern-ish Earth start to get powers that would be withon range of technology in a couple hundred years. Turns out this is due to cross-timeline bleed, after an enemy of humanity changed the past to slow down technological progress and make them easier to beat.
- An archaeology team uncovers a Saxon warlord. Suddenly: revenants.
  - cough*MarlowWarlord*cough
- Noah's Ark reinterpretation whereby the "ark" was a time travel machine which the inventor was really reluctant to use because of the moral implications of destroying all humanity born after the arrival time. Eventually *something* happens (alien invasion?) and everyone is gonna die anyway, so he jumps. Focus is on ethics of TT; punchline is that the revised timeline is our own and not much has changed (or at least not enough to avert the coming apocalypse).
  - the Flood becomes the Great Deletion of the time travel itself, filtered through Bronze Age tribal histories

### Strawberry Court

A young man moves into a block of flats: an old converted victorian house surrounding a central courtyard. Nice place, friendly neighbours: a cute girl, a traditional middle-aged couple, a sweet old granny, a group of yobs-with-hearts-of-gold. Shame about Rick, the creepy mute guy on the top floor, but at least he's a good rock guitar player.

Then one night he looks across the courtyard through a window and sees Mary, the cute one, climbing a ladder and tying a noose round her neck. He rushes round... and she answers the door in confusion. No step, no rope. But a slightly funny look in her eye...

Another night he sees a husband stab his wife then himself. He rushes round again and they're fine... apart from the eyes. And their shadows don't quite move right.

Rinse and repeat for old lady having a seizure. And all the while he starts seeing increasing signs of eldritch haunting: dark tentacles in the shadows, dreams of black flames, strange stains, and all to the eerie tune of that *fucking* guitar.

As things start to spiral, he links up with the street-gang wannabes for mutual defence from the apparent invasion of pod people that are now blocking the way out. Until he looks across the courtyard... and sees them being gunned down. So the people he's hooked up with are more pod people. Shit. The only way left is up.

He runs up the final set of stairs and bangs on Rick's door. On opening, he barges in, slams it behind him, and frantically checks the mute guitarist for signs of corruption. All good. Now can Rick please explain what the hell is going on?

Rick, looking equally horrified, starts scribbling down notes, until creepy guitar music starts coming in *through the damn window*. Rick starts trying to drown it out with normal music, at which point the MC realises: that's not the old man he's been hearing all this time. He pulls open the curtains, looks down into the courtyard, and [oh](https://giphy.com/gifs/the-lord-of-rings-return-king-10wgT5PDnOwMQE) [crap](https://tenor.com/view/jack-sparrow-kraken-pirates-of-the-caribbean-gif-14820358).

Cue frantic flight into the darkness, dodging tentacles and pod people,  before collapsing in the street.

When he wakes up where he collapsed the following morning, he finds that the back-alley that used to lead to Strawberry Court is gone: bricked up and with years worth of graffiti covering the brickwork. He hammers at it and manages to dislodge a loose brick... seeing that behind it is the overgrown remains of burned ruin. Then the police pick him up and he gets shipped off to an asylum.

The story is told through the lens of the MC in the asylum speaking to his psychiatrist who, of course, believes that this was all hallucinated. The psych eventually diagnoses it as a one-off psychotic break with no signs of relapse and signs him out into his parents' custody.

As they walk out, the dad mentions "none of that Strawberry Court nonsense". "Oh", says the receptionist, "that's a blast from the past - my older cousin lived there back before the fire. Must be five years ago now? She was a sweet girl, Mary; shame about the suicide."

And in the mirror behind her the MC sees the shadows start to writhe...

This is basically a modern take on [The Music of Erich Zann](http://dagonbytes.com/thelibrary/lovecraft/themusicoferichzann.htm). However I actually came up with the original bits first and twisted it into an homage to Zann later.

Need to flesh out the early bits. E.g. sexual overtones, where the MC is watching out of his window to see Mary change... and then, after her apparent suicide, pod!Mary keeps trying to invite him in for some fun. And his relationship with the yoof who are armed and guard the block.
- Just to be clear: they aren't actually pod people. Some kind of demonic doppelganger or a figment of his imagination.
- (I'm obviously trying to leave it as open as possible whether any of this shit actually happened, or whether he's just another homeless crazy.

I'm writing this summary after watching [Hereditary](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt7784604/), directed by Ari Aster, so I'm naturally imagining this as a screenplay. A few thoughts on a hypothetical filming:
- Different tones for different elements: cold grey for the asylum, happy (and slightly hazy) greens and yellows for the daytime at SC, blacks and reds for night at the SC
  - Ideally have the asylum feel slightly unreal and Groundhog Day-ish: after each flashback ends, have a shot of him being taken out of his room to see the psych for the next session.
- Never show the courtyard in darkness, only the MC's room and the TV-screen-like square of the lit window
- When Rick is playing the guitar, have the film soundtrack music accompanying him... then in the climax have the MC visibly able to hear that music coming through the window.
- The deaths should gradually move up the block as the film goes on, mirroring the flight up to Rick's room.
- Everything after the MC looks out of Rick's window should be a series of confused flashes in the dark. The first of which should be Rick's visibly dead face as music continues to spill from his guitar amp.
