# Haemoglobin

## Summary

An attempt to produce plausible-sounding technobabble for vampirism.  I *think* it was intended as an April Fool's for submission to PLoS.

Found this in my Oliver Wyman-era files (I used to work on stuff like this on my OW laptop on the train home).

Mitochondrial heteroplasmicity with pathological behaviour: case history

1. Patient VT referred to hospital for extreme ADHD and malnutrition (anaemia)
1. Improved nutrition did not improve patient's condition.  Patient's outbursts increasing in violence
1. Referred to specialist paediatric unit
1. Testing showed mitochondrial abnormalities and blood chemistry divergence.  Dietary supplements fixed anaemia.
1. Patient is currently stable.  Mitochondrial abnormalities have increased but in presence of supplements are symptom-free.

### Patient details

Male age 10 at time of initial referral; currently 12.

### Symptoms

+ Anaemia caused by low haem count
+ ADHD with occasional psychotic episodes

### Biology

+ Patient is biplasmic (designated here as type U and V)
+ Surprisingly, assays do not indicate that VT's mother (AB) is mitoheteroplasmic; mtDNA corresponds to VT's type U mitochondria
+ Type U (maternal) appears normal in function.  Most prevalent in tissues with lower metabolic rate.
+ Type V (source unknown) has very high count in "working" tissues (esp muscles and liver).  It displays far lower free-radical leakage than average human mitochondria.  It also displays strong sequence divergence from standard human mtDNA {insert phylo tree}.

Initially, type V was most prevalent in head/upper-chest muscles and organs.  However, in later assays, type V was also found in significant quantities in lower torso and upper leg tissue samples; type A prevalence fell accordingly.  This strongly suggests that type V is latent in all tissues and is only gradually becoming active, possibly due to hormonal signalling.

A controversial but attractive alternative hypothesis is that the organelle is actively seeding itself between cells, behaving as an infectious species.  It is known that mitochondria can transfer between cells[a].  This would also explain the uncertain origins of type V - and, given the extreme sequence divergence from typical human mtDNA, would hint at a zoonotic origin.  However, although pathogenisation of animal tissue is not unheard-of[b], it is exceedingly rare.  Mechanism of organelle exfiltration / infiltration past cell membrane is currently unknown.

### Attached data

+ Type A mtDNA sequence
+ Type B mtDNA sequence {use bat, apply realistic (?) fuzz}

### Response to treatment

Haem-enriched diet alleviated symptoms of anaemia and, to a lesser extent, ADHD/psychosis.  Later surveys showed that mitochondrion count had further increased, however as long as VT is on enriched diet there appear to be no side-effects.  Preliminary attempts to wean VT off diet triggered violent behaviour.  When in good health VT displays an unusual level of strength and cardio fitness for a 10-year-old.  Therefore, to protect the health of hospital staff, no further attempts have been made.
