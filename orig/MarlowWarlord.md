# Marlow Warlord story

## Summary

An archaeology team uncovers a Saxon warlord. Suddenly: revenants.

## Synopsis

Four parts:
1) Initial world-building in context of archaeological dig
	- introduce arch site, burial, dig team
	- enthusiasm builds, people start staying over in tents
2) Deaths and disappearances start
	- ratchet up the tension
	- start of an informal conspiracy to keep digging rather than report the "issues" to police
	- enthusiasm starts to seem unhealthy
3) Revenant exposed and fought
	- cries in the darkness in Old English: "you shall not release it!"
	- climax is the revenant getting dragged off by Something from the next stratum down
4) Aftermath and fridge horror


## Author's notes

This story is based on the Marlow Warlord dig that my dad [helped excavate](https://www.berksarch.co.uk/index.php/marlow-warlord-an-excavators-experience/).  It's a revenant story, but... what?  Just bog-standard mummy/vampire awakening?  Or... what was the "Warlord" guarding and keeping imprisoned?  Once the revenant has been put down, are we on a timer for something worse to emerge?  (Have the revenant speak Old English, but leave this bit of fridge horror untranslated in the text as an easter egg.)

Style: personal journal?  (C.f. Mountains of Madness!)
