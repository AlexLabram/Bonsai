# How Not To Kill A Real Bonsai
## (A beginner's guide)

So you've found yourself in possession of a bonsai tree.  Maybe it's a gift from another layman, maybe your cousin who is obsessed with tiny trees has finally run out of space in the garden, maybe you just bought one on a whim.

The first question you should ask at this point is: how can you *keep on* being in possession of a bonsai, as opposed to a piece of dead wood in a pretty pot.  This guide is intended to get you over this initial hurdle.  Following it will ensure that the tree survives long enough for you to decide whether to take the art of bonsai seriously... or whether to palm off your white elephant on some other poor sucker.

## Disclaimers

This is *only* an introduction, intended to buy you a few months' grace period.  If you rely on it in the long term, you're an idiot and your tree didn't deserve what you did to it.

The author is not a bonsai professional; he's just been to a few courses and filled half his flat with small pots.  As with all advice off the interwebs, you get what you pay for: if your sixty-year-old prizewinning juniper dies as a result of it, you're an idiot and your tree didn't deserve what you did to it.

If you're willing to pay for better advice, there's a [Further Information](#further-information) section below.  If - even after reading this section - you're willing to pay the *author* for better advice, you're an idiot and your tree doesn't deserve what you're about to do to it.

## What do you mean, "real" bonsai?

The first thing to note here is that most trees marketed as "bonsai" don't really match the historical definition of the term.  In particular, vast nurseries in the cheaper areas of South-East Asia ship over ludicrous numbers of tiny ficuses[^ficus] every year.

These are cool household or terrarium plants - I have a couple myself - and at this point caring for them probably counts as an art form in its own right.  But this kind of I-Can't-Believe-It's-Not-Bonsai (hitherto: ICBINB) doesn't require the same level of precision as caring for a more traditional japanese-style bonsai tree.

Your tree is probably a "real" (japanese-style) bonsai if:

+ It is a temperate (non-tropical) tree that can survive typical UK winters.  For this reason, japanese-style bonsai is often also referred to as outdoor bonsai[^outdoor].
  - The other legit bonsai style is chinese, or indoor bonsai, which uses the same tree types as ICBINB but takes the whole thing more seriously.
+ The soil is made of small chunks of "akadama" (basically: half-baked clay), pumice and other stuff that drains really well.
  - A japanese bonsai's soil may be covered by either dry moss (usually sphagnum) or actual live moss, so you might need to prod it a bit to find out.
  - ICBINB, by contrast, tends to use some mix of coir (coconut fibre - a green alternative to peat), sand and wood chips.  All of these tend to suck up water and hold onto it, meaning that you don't need to water them so frequently but you have less control over precisely how much water is in the soil at any point in time.
+ The pot is a proper bonsai pot: shallow, fired clay (or a plastic reproduction thereof), and with relatively large holes in the bottom.
  - ...When I say "large", I mean a centimetre or two as opposed to the half-centimetre holes you generally see in plastic plant-pots.
  - To stop all the soil falling out, a bonsai pot will typically have a grille (plastic or metal) wired into place just inside the hole.
+ The tree has wire holding its root ball and branches in position.
  - Note that wire on the branches isn't compulsory: unless you're planning to enter a bonsai competition in the near future, most trees are left un-wired for most of the year to avoid unsightly notches forming in the bark.
  - To check for root-ball wiring, look underneath the pot.  In addition to the thick wire keeping the grille in place, there should be some thinner wire that loops up through the soil, wraps round the trunk, then loops back down.
+ The tree looks like a scaled-down version of an actual wild tree.
  - By contrast, chinese bonsai tends to look like a dragon or gargoyle (if you really squint!) and ICBINB looks like a blob with legs.
  - A caveat here: there is one style of japanese bonsai, called "bunjingi" in japanese or "literati" in english, which throws this rule out the window and goes wild.  If the plant seems to consist mostly of oddly-curved wire, it's probably literati.

## Calamity #1: Under-watering

Bonsai are not like most pot plants: as noted above, their soil is intended to drain relatively quickly.  This is to avoid water-logging, which tends to make trees' roots rot, and to allow you to simulate the effect of a real-world circadian water cycle[^circadian].

Thus, the biggest cause of death for real bonsai is when you forget it for a week and come back to find all the leaves have gone brown.

This is an even bigger issue:

+ If your bonsai is small, since the pots don't hold a lot of water at the best of times.
  - Small bonsai are technically classified as "sh≈çhin" (literally: small work) aka "one-handed" - as in, you can carry it with a single hand - or "mame" (literally: bean; pronounced "mam-ay") aka "palm-sized".
  - There are even smaller classes of bonsai beyond mame.  If you got one of these as your starter bonsai, you're an idiot and your tree doesn't deserve what you're about to do to it.
+ If it's summer.
  - This is due to both the more intense sun and the two weeks you're about to spend in Barbados.
+ If your tree is somewhere particular hot and/or arid.
  - For example, if you've put your tree directly above an active radiator or close to the oven, you're an idiot and your tree didn't deserve what you did to it.

There are two basic approaches to watering a bonsai: from above with caution, or from below with enthusiasm.

### Watering from above

If you have a lot of bonsai, they're actually outdoors at least some of the time, and you can afford to hunt for the perfect watering can, you can just water them pretty much like you would a normal plant.  However, there are two caveats:

+ Due to the thick layer of dry and/or live moss, it's easy for water to run off a bonsai before it reaches the soil.  The best approach here is to water once, then wait a few minutes for it to seep into the live moss, then water again, then wait for a few minutes for it to seep through the sphagnum, then water a third time to actually moisten the soil.
  - The logic here is that, once each layer has had time to properly soak, the water in it creates capillaries that let the next pass quickly seep through to the layer below.
  - Easy test: if you can see a small amount of water coming out the bottom of the pot, you've hit pay dirt (as well as literal dirt).  If you see a *lot* of water coming out, you've overdone it you fool.
+ The soil in real bonsai pots tends to form a bit of a hill rising up from the pot.  It's very easy for heavy streams of water to either mess up the shape of the "terrain" or just wash the crumbly akadama / pumice / etc away entirely.  Moss is even more vulnerable.  The ideal solution here is to get a watering can with a downward-facing rose and twist it so that it's upward-facing.  This takes a lot of the kinetic energy out of the flow of water.
  - That said, I've been casually looking for a suitable watering can in gardening centres and tool shops for months and I can't find one anywhere.  If you come across a source in central London, please drop me a line before I'm forced to resort to Amazon.

### Watering from below

If you have only a few small bonsai, or if they are purely indoor pets, then you can just half-fill a basin of water, lower them into it until the water comes up to the lip of the pot, then wait until it bubbles up through the soil and starts visibly moistening the moss.  This is also known as "dunking".

A few caveats:

+ If you let the water spill over the lip then, as with watering from above, you're likely to lose soil and/or moss.  Take it carefully.
+ As time goes by between re-pottings, the soil in a pot naturally becomes more compact and slower-draining.  A newly re-potted bonsai can be dunked by hand, but once it's been around for a year or two you probably *don't* want to stand there waiting for it to soak: your arm will go dead first.
  - Best solution here is to put the bonsai in an under-filled pot then slooooowly add water until you reach the lip.
  - I've ended up with a complicated arrangement for watering different bonsai pots in parallel without flooding a pot or unduly wasting water.  It still takes the best part of an hour, albeit mostly becaus I inevitably get distracted half-way.

### Does your bonsai even need watering yet?

Most of the time you won't need to water you bonsai every day, but you will need to *check* whether it needs watering pretty much daily.  The easiest way is to touch the trunk: if it feels tangibly cold then the tree is fine.  If you can't feel anything, prod the soil: if it's moist, you're good.  If it's dry at the top then water it.  In the height of summer, you may actually need to water your trees every day, and even spray them with water[^spray] if they start to dry out in late afternoon.

### What if I can't water regularly?

If you can't commit to watering your bonsai for an extended period - because you're on holiday, or away on business, or hospitalised, or chronically depressed, or just plain bad at watering - your best bet is to find someone reliable who is willing to do it for you.  However, there are a couple of back-up options that can potentially extend your tree's life expectancy until your return.

1. For very short periods, you can stick the bonsai somewhere dark and shady.  In the long run the lack of light will kill it, but the dehydration would have killed it faster.
1. For slightly longer periods, but still under a week, you can put the pot in a bowl of water, filled to halfway up the pot's side.  Again this is the lesser of two evils: if you leave it for too long then the roots will rot (see [Over-Watering](#calamity-2-over-watering) below).
1. Some bonsai can do relatively well in a sealed terrarium or empty fish-tank that has been thoroughly moistened.  The water will evaporate during the day, but recondenses at night.  However, if it gets too hot... ever eaten steamed asparagus?
1. If you only have a couple of small bonsai, and need longer-term protection, a rather extreme solution is to firmly plant the entire bonsai pot up to the lip in a much larger vessel.  The larger mass of soil will retain water for much longer, and it will be wicked up into the bonsai pot as needed.
1. For larger bonsai, or for extended periods, consider investing in a timer system, as used with water sprinklers for lawns.

## Calamity #4: But... but... pruning!

No.  Stop.  Drop those secateurs and step away from the pot with your hands up.  Then slap the aforementioned hands across your face until you lose the urge to try again.

Laypeople tend to think of pruning and branch wiring as the "true" bonsai art.  In a way they're right: these are the most quintessentially bonsai-ish bits of the craft, and they are essential to keeping a tree attractive over a period of years, decades or even centuries (millennia is a work-in-progress).  However, they are also the bit that your tree can cheerfully go a year or two without.

Conversely, your tree *cannot* go very long without the 3/4 of its foliage you just chopped off, you frikkin' n00b.  And - unless you have a truly incredible artistic eye - you probably didn't even chop off the right bits.  Or you started angsting over the precise arrangement of some new twigs that no-one will care about in a couple of years.  Or you didn't give sufficient thought to concepts like "nebari" (root flare)
, choice of front, style, spacing, etc etc etc.

Even if you *do* start training up as a proper bonsai practitioner, fiddling with branches is way down the list of things to learn about.  In particular, it falls well after re-potting your tree, which is genuinely a very involved art, and one that has to be done every time the tree gets pot-bound or things become messy.  Bottom line: you are not going to be pruning your bonsai any time soon; if you do, you're an idiot and your tree doesn't deserve what you're doing to it.

The one exception here: if you bought a tree with its branches already wired then you'll need to remove that wire before it starts to bite into the steadily-growing trunk.  This can generally be done with a normal set of DIY wire-cutters if you're careful.  However, even in this case, you've probably got a year or two before it really becomes an issue, so don't panic or start making hasty decisions.  That wire was probably applied for a reason and, if you remove it too soon, the tree will snap back to its original pre-wiring shape.

## Further information

By this point you should be able to ensure that your newly-acquired tree won't die embarrassingly quickly.  For everything else, there's ~Mastercard~ more detailed information sources out there.

My instructor is Mark D'Cruz of [MƒÉ-k√® Bonsai](https://www.makebonsai.com/) in Hounslow.  He's very down-to-earth, practical-minded, and enthusiastic about passing his knowledge on to the next generation.  And, whilst he is theoretically retiring abroad soon (as of 2021), he'll still be visiting the UK indefinitely to run workshops etc.  If you want more info, and you live within striking range of Hounslow (trains run from Clapham J to Whitton), and you can afford it, you could do a lot worse than book into his next Boot Camp.

If you can't afford it or live too far away, you could do a lot worse than looking up his rather comprehensive set of [Youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/MaKeBonsai) instead.  It's not a substitute for finding a real in-person teacher - there's just too much that you can accidentally do wrong unless someone points it out - but it's a damn good start.

There are a ludicrous number of other options, whether in-person, online, or (ironically) in dead-tree format.  If you'd like me to sanity-check a source then just [drop me a line](mailto:alex@m2cc.co.uk).

Finally, my local pub-equivalent is the [Tea House Theatre](https://www.teahousetheatre.co.uk/) in Vauxhall.  If you see a tall brown-blond caucasian guy rambling about some obscure technical or philosophical topic, it's probably me - come say hi!

[^ficus]: These are the ones that look like a mandrake from Harry Potter - a bunch of bulbous roots with a tiny little trunk and a toup√©e of small green leaves.  They are typically produced cheaply by grafting the bottom of a large immature tree (since mature trees don't have the ugly-cute roots) to the top of a small mature tree (since large trees don't have the tiny leaves).
[^outdoor]: This applies even if the trees in question are kept indoors.  For example, I have a bunch of "outdoor" elms and maples on my windowsill because I live in south London and if I left them outside then they'd be nicked in short order.
[^circadian]: Or something like that.  I may have misunderstood my instructor on this point.
[^spray]: The logic here seems to be that adding more water vapour to the atmosphere around the soil surface slows the rate of evaporation.  I have personally started using de-ionised water, since I'm sick of seeing my moss going white from limescale.  London tap water is *hard*.
