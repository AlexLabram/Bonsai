# To do

Improvements I need to make to my creative writing process

+ General principles:
  - **Better ideas capture.**  Currently a lot of ideas arrive "in a dream" and never get put down because I forget them too fast.
  - **Close down on at least a few ideas.**  It's good to have lots of snippets in development, but until the Likes start rolling in I'll struggle to develop a proper writing habit.  Furthermore, I need to get enough stuff out there that one flop doesn't destroy my ego!
  - **Make more time for writing.**  Maybe I need a list of daily tasks?  (After speaking with a masseur, stretching out should probably be on there too!)
+ Systems
  - **Markdown to BBCode "compilation".**  It'd be nice to standardise on the former for anything that can show up on Github.com, but the actual sites often need the latter.  And I keep getting my `*` pairs confused with my `[i]` blocks.
  - **Automatic uploader.**  If I could set things up so that changes to the local BBCode automatically get "published" to the server, that'd be amazing.  Would require a fair amount of intricate site-scraping code and/or API investigation, though, so not a priority for me.
  - **Optimise the editor settings.**  Esp. regards handling of tabs/spaces
  - **Confirm that the blog still works.** And, when it inevitably doesn't, fix whatever broke.  Maybe set up an install script for future use.
+ Admin
  - **Integrate my pre-netbook writings.**  Current pipeline is: random hard disk => StorageSD (D:) => Documents/{repo}/Unfiled/ => {repo}.  I need to keep moving stuff along the pipeline at all stages!  This will involve some sorting/triage: for example, anything factual should probably get dumped in the blog repository.
