# Bonsai on a Budget: practical exercises

<details>

## Meta - hide/remove before sharing

### Why this page

These exercises are intended to be suitable for a single-day "bonsai bootcamp" style course, focusing on producing simple doodles with cheap materials.

I've split them out from the single-day course outline because:
a. They don't line up precisely with the theory (for example: 
a. They're really the main part of the course that focuses on the "budget" part; most of the rest is re-useable

### To do
+ Review practicals for readability
+ Fill out bounty board with pic requests for hands-on tasks

## Practical 1: Bonsai display appreciation

+ Which bonsai is your favourite and why?
+ Do they look better from a particular angle?
+ Which ones look more natural (Japanese style) or grotesque (Chinese style)?

### Practical 2: Seeing with new eyes

Quick wander round Walworth Gardens
+ Mature trees: spot the features that make them look old
+ Young trees: spot the _lack_ of these features
+ Heavily styled trees: what would you need to do to produce a bonsai?

Alternatively, stay inside and flick through a bonsai book!

### Practical 3: Choose your bonsai / pot

+ Tree types on offer
	- Bring your own (free, obviously)
	- "Urban yamadori" samples (free)
	- Selected cheaply-sourced trees... i.e. anything I spot at Tesco (free)
	- Walworth Gardens stock (as priced)
		- ... but we don't recommend you spend too much cos you're probably going to kill it
+ Pot types on offer
	- Improvised / "recycled" (free)
	- Drilled china (free... especially if you bring your own!)
	- Concrete (free)
	- Plastic bonsai training pot (free? xxxx)
	- Ceramic (as priced)
+ Considerations
	- The tree must in principle be able to fit in the pot!
	- Pot appropriate to tree
	- Pot appropriate to style (e.g. deep pots for cascade)
	- Speak to me before buying any trees so I can confirm that they're suitable

### Practical 4: Preparing your pot

1. If needed, clean the pot in water, using a toothbrush to get rid of any encrusted dirt
1. Cut a suitable chunk of mesh, and use short sections of 2mm wire to fix it in place over the drainage hole
	- Repeat as needed if there are multiple holes
	- If the pot is rectangular, oval or obround, make sure that the mesh wire(s) is pointing along the pot's central axis
	- Trim any excess wire off with the bonsai wire-cutters
		- This step isn't vital for newbies; it's just to stop loose ends of wire scratching a display surface
1. Cut two longer sections of 1.5mm wire ("anchor wires") and push their ends up through the pot's drainage hole(s) (or wire holes if it has them)
	- If the pot has wire holes or multiple drainage holes, run the wire between them
	- If the pot has only one hole, make a V in the middle of each anchor wire and push them up straddling the mesh wire (one at each end)
	- Attach the wires asymmetrically, with longer ends on one side of the pot and shorter ends on the other, so that you're not trying to twist the ends together directly over a root
	- Don't cross anchor wires over each other underneath the pot
1. Smooth the anchor wire against the sides of the pot, and fold the excess down over the rim
	- I find it helpful to put an extra upwards bend in the longer wire, so that I can remember which was supposed to be which...

### Practical 5: De-potting your bonsai

1. Remove existing pot (taking off wire if needed) and place in tray provided
1. Brush all moss, weeds and excess soil off top surface with chopstick
	- This uncovers the nebari... or, for young trees, the lateral roots that will eventually help form it
	- Keep an eye open for any signs of pests in the soil
1. If trunk is dirty or moss-covered, clean with a damp toothbrush
	- Moss on trunks looks cool but is bad for the tree's health
1. Decide how you'd like the tree to sit in the pot
	a. Angle: Usually we want the tree to emerge vertically, but a few styles get more creative
	a. "Front": We must establish the direction from which the tree is intended to be viewed
	a. Positioning: Asymmetric styles may work better with the tree off to one side
	- This decision may need re-visiting if the roots don't behave like you expect; in the worst case you may have to change pot
1. Trim off any roots that were growing along the sides of the pot
1. Work the roots back to fit in the pot
	1. Loosen dirt round the edges / bottom with chopstick
	1. Trim off exposed roots with root shears (or nail scissors!)
		- Big roots may need a branch cutter (or secateurs)
		- _Really_ big roots may need a saw!
	1. Repeat until tree fits in pot with 1/2 cm clearance at sides and bottom
1. Squirt any exposed roots with water

### Practical 6a: Anchoring your bonsai
1. Put a layer of (dry) bonsai soil along the bottom of the pot
1. Position the tree as desired
1. Fill in the gaps around the root ball with more soil
1. Compress the soil down as much as possible
	- Make a first attempt using your thumbs, adding more soil as needed
	- Afterwards, tap the pot gently with a (non-metal) mallet or similar, to help the soil flow into any cavities
	- If the root ball is a weird shape, a bit of fiddling with chopsticks may be required to fill in the gaps
1. Grab one of the anchor wires' long end, guide it past the trunk, and pull it slowly and gently towards the short end until it hooks on the root ball.
1. Pull the corresponding short end gently up until it also hooks on the root ball
1. Gently twist the wires together with your fingers
	- Ideally you should ensuring that the meeting point isn't directly on top of a root
1. Repeat the last two steps with the other anchor wire
1. Twist the wire ends together with pliers until all the slack is taken up
	- This is tricky: you almost certainly will break a lot of wire as you learn!
	- Pull the wire gently as you twist it, so that the newly taken up wire doesn't wrap on top of the previous twists
	- Keep the twisted wire at the same angle to both single strands (the "bisector" in maths jargon) so that neither strand gets twisted more sharply than the other
	- Broken wire can be patched together with an extra length of 1.5mm wire
	- Traditionally you'd use "jin pliers" for this, but I find needle-tip pliers just as good
1. Repeat the last step with the other anchor wire
1. Remove any excess anchor wire
	- It's generally best to retain 3-4 turns of the twisted wire
	- You may want to snip off any _really_ excessive bits of wire before using the pliers to tighten it, so they don't smack into the tree every turn!
1. Once the tree is anchored in place, thoroughly water the bonsai (e.g. by dunking)

### Practical 6b: Covering your soil
1. Grate some dry sphagnum through a xxxx cm mesh sieve
	- We've done this bit for you
1. Put a handful in a pot and mix with water
	- Sphagnum absorbs a lot of moisture - if you can't see free water then you haven't added enough
1. Transfer the mix a large pinch at a time to your pot, covering the entire surface with about 0.5cm of loosely-packed spagnum
1. Gently press down with your fingers, squeezing the spagnum against the soil
	- This also squeezes a lot of the water out of the sphagnum, which causes it to bind to itself like pressed felt
	- If you've got a big patch of soil to cover, be careful that pushing on one side doesn't send soil flying out of another!

### Practical 7a: Designing the tree
1. If you have a smartphone, look up some pictures of what an adult tree of your chosen species might look like in the wild
	- Does it normally grow straight, or does it twist all over the place?
	- Is the leaf dome tall and narrow or short and broad?
	- Do the branches angle upwards or downwards as they leave the trunk?
	- Do the branches follow a single curve or a series of stepped arcs?  Are the arcs up-and-out or down-and-in?
1. Draw a doodle of how you'd like your tree to look, taking note of the positioning of major branches on its trunk

### Practical 7b: Wiring the trunk

### Practical 7c: Pruning and wiring the branches
1. Prune off any clearly unwanted branches
