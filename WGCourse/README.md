# Bonsai on a Budget

This folder contains courseware relating to my "Bonsai on a Budget" workshop, to be presented at Walworth Gardens in April '23.

Currently this is limited to my presenters' notes, but I hope to add useful images, diagrams, reference tables etc as I produce or obtain them.

### Forward planning

I would very much like to produce a re-useable resource here, rather than yet another pile of personal notes.  Ideally the end-game would be to put together a reasonably comprehensive resource, a la Wikibooks, at least for the basics.  (Alternatively, there's a pay-what-you-want site for technical books... which I've forgotten the URL of.  D'oh.)

Relatedly, I will probably end up licensing this under [CC-BY](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/cc-by-4.0/) or similar... but I can't commit to that yet because the repository may temporarily include more stringently-licensed files (e.g. scanned images from books used as placeholders) until I can replace them with my own content.  In the meantime, please drop me a line if you would like to reuse anything; it is almost certain that I'll say yes.

### To do
+ Finish first draft of outline
+ Identify most critical areas for course
+ Flesh out into training deck/notes + presenter's notes
	- Make sure headings are aligned with summary
+ Make bounty board of: tree photos/drawings; diagrams; tabular info
	- Or stub in fake diagrams and use the issue tracker?

### Components
+ [Course contents listing](IntroContents.md): because this list includes the practicals, which may vary depending on course location and resources
+ [Practical exercises](IntroPracticals.md): because they don't follow the same structure as the theory, and may vary slightly depending on course location and resources (e.g. if I start doing a higher-budget bonsai bootcamp)
+ [April 2023 event page](2023-04_WGIntro.md) for non-reuseable info
