## Meta - hide/remove before sharing

### Why this page
+ This is currently an outline of the theoretical content that will be presented during the workshop, and can act as presenter's notes for same.
+ In the longer term I'd like to break some of these sections out into separate MD files and rewrite them as prose rather than bullets, with the long-run goal of moving to R Bookdown or similar.

## Bonsai background

### Why we appreciate bonsai
+ Bonsai brings nature into unnatural environments
	- Home / office (for short periods or "indoor" species)
	- Formal garden
+ Bonsai has style
	- Japanese style: naturalistic
	- Chinese style: gargoyle
	- Western rube style: "I Can't Believe It's Not Bonsai" aka "Mall Bonsai" aka "Nonsai"
+ Bonsai has history
	- India: xxxx
	- Buddhism: xxxx
	- China: xxxx
	- Japan: xxxx
	- Bonsai diaspora: xxxx
	- Related arts: penjing, hon no bo, saikei
+ Bonsai has convenience
	- ...At least compared to a full tree / garden
	- xxxx Example: Alex's wall o' bonsai
+ Bonsai is educational and therapeutic
	- Improves awareness of what a tree needs to survive
	- Tactile and artistic elements
	- Become the god of a tiny world

### How we appreciate bonsai
+ Styles
	- Japanese styles: xxxx show pictures here
	- Chinese styles: xxxx show pictures here
	- "Literati": Japanese style based on imported Chinese ([Southern Song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_School)) woodcuts
	- Misc others e.g. Pierneef style from African Savannahs
+ Qualities
	- Appearance of age
		- Ramification
		- "Nebari" (root flare - one of three japanese words you want to know)
		- Proportionality (where possible)
	- Spread
		- Focus
		- Dynamism
		- Negative space
	- Special features
		- Extreme size (either small or large)
		- Flowers / fruit
		- Integral deadwood / rocks
+ Misc fluff
	- Buddhist principles
	- General Japanese-ness
		- Minimalism: contra "I have made this longer than usual because I have not had time to make it shorter."
		- Appearance of austerity: "the art that conceals art"
		- Creating Kodak moments, long before Kodak!

## Bonsai overview

### The bonsai lifecycle
+ xxxx Lifecycle diagram
+ Created from non-bonsai "material"
	- Choice of species
		- Outdoor (Japanese style) vs indoor (Chinese style)
			- Casual bonsai owners trying to keep an outdoor tree indoors is possibly the biggest killer of outdoor bonsai
		- Broadleaf vs conifer
		- xxxx Cladistic ~~tree~~ diagram
	- Sources
		- seeds (serious enthusiasts only!  Ignore "grow your own bonsai" kits)
		- cuttings from mature bonsai
		- non-bonsai seedlings/whips (esp. for "literati" styles)
		- non-bonsai mature trees
+ Kept alive for years / decades
	- Watering (!!!)
	- Pest control (!)
	- Heat
	- Light
	- Fertilising (micronutrients)
	- Air circulation (?)
+ Given treatment that lets them thrive (in the desired directions)
	- Cleaning & weeding
	- Fertilising (NPK)
	- Repotting - force a strong root ball rather than unnecessary deep/wide roots
	- Pruning - recapitulate the natural history of branch death
	- Wiring - recapitulate the natural history of branch strain / light-seeking
+ Occasional drastic action
	- Extreme Styling™
		- Trunk splitting
		- Grafting
		- Deadwood styling: jin (bare branch), shari (bare trunk), uro (cavity), sabamiki (split trunk)
	- Extreme Potting™
		- Root-over-rock style
		- Root-on-rock style
		- Moss ball ("kokedama")
		- Multiple tree styles
	- Extreme Propagating™
		- Layering
		- Air layering
		- Just cutting big chunks off an existing bonsai
	- Sticking the tree back in the ground to grow out
	- ...This section not discussed further here (we're focused on survive+thrive)
+ Prepping for display
	- Pot aesthetics
		- shape / finish / decoration
		- "masculine" (heavy) vs "feminine" (light)
	- Ornaments, accent plants and display rocks
	- Last-minute fixes: moss, small branch wiring
	- Stands & displays
	- Photography technique
	- ...This section not discussed further here (we're focused on survive+thrive)
+ End-of-life
	- Resale
		- Bonsai pricing gets very complicated!
		- Good record-keeping is vital if you ever plan to sell on, especially with expensive pots/trees or unusual material
	- Death
		- Always take the time to understand what killed your tree!
		- "Looks dead" doesn't always mean "is dead": scratch bark to check if the cambium is still green
		- If some life remains, emergency cuttings can be taken or the tree can be restyled as jin
		- Soil from dead plants can often be recycled if dried and sieved (unless dead of disease / pests)
	- ...This section not discussed further here (we're focused on survive+thrive)

### Doing it on the cheap
+ Easy ways to start bonsai:
	- Mature bonsai (i.e. large trunk relative to pot; good distinctive shape; has stopped trying too hard to grow)
	- Large numbers (nurseries)
	- Large pots (water control)
	- Lots of outside growing space, light/shade, etc
	- Good-quality specialist tools & materials (pots, soils, wire etc)
	- Experienced bonsai instructor
+ ...these all take £££ (or apprenticeship)
+ The alternative: YOLO / for science!
	- Cheap material: "urban yamadori", seeds/cuttings, knocked-down stock, rescued ICBINB
	- Improvised tools
	- Iterative: expect many to die; goal is to learn from mistakes
	- Training sources: Youtube, community, amateur instructors (!)
+ If your tree is healthy and attractive, how you got there is less important
	- Corollary: real bonsai practitioners know their way round power tools >:-D

## Bonsai care

+ Why is it so !"£$% difficult?
	- The practitioner is God... and this is the downside
	- Must provide everything that trees usually get from the environment / ecosystem

### Watering
+ Significance
	- Mis-watering is probably the biggest killer of bonsai
	- Under-watering: root hairs (microscopic) dry up and die off
	- Over-watering: roots "drown" and die off (esp. when overcompensating for under-watering!)
	- Trad. bonsai soil drains well but is esp. prone to drying out completely
+ When to water
	- Back-of-hand test
	- Varies based on: bonsai/pot size; season (and location); species
+ Approaches:
	1. Dunking
		- Fill a bowl or basin with water
		- Place bonsai in water with water level slightly below the soil surface
		- Wait until surface is visibly wet before removing (may take longer or shorter depending on soil type, dryness, how long bonsai has been in pot)
		- Suitable for up to about 5 bonsai; any more and it starts to take forever
		- Water impurities tend to be driven upwards over time; water from the top occasionally to rinse them away
		- Solid fertiliser will just sit on the surface; use liquid feed instead
	1. "Bottle feeding"
		- Buy a small spray bottle and (empty) ketchup squeezy bottle and fill with water
		- Use spray bottle to wet the surface of the soil (or dried sphagnum) to break the surface tension
		- Gently squeeze water into the soil from close range; pause when the surface gets waterlogged; stop when water starts coming out the bottom
		- Suitable for up to about 10 bonsai
		- Appropriate for indoor bonsai where getting water everywhere is a bad thing
	1. Watering can
		- Buy a watering can with a slanted rose (e.g. Haws 700ml)
		- Water _three_ times per pot: once to break the surface tension, once to wet the upper soil, once to go right through; leave a short pause in between
		- Suitable for ~40-50 outdoor bonsai
		- Less suitable for indoor due to mess, and gets more time-consuming in hot weather (up to 1/2 hour per day!)
	1. Garden hose spray nozzle
		- Easiest approach for large bonsai collections, but requires more up-front effort

### Pest control
+ Significance
	- Pest infestations are the third biggest killer of bonsai
		- ...Also often the final nail in the coffin when keeping outdoor trees indoors
	- Many pests that would typically be taken care of by a tree's ecosystem (birds, other insects, etc) become far more dangerous for bonsai
+ Leaf pests
	- Aphids / greenfly
	- Spider mites
	- Leaf miners (fly larvae)
	- Weevils
+ Root pests
	- Grubs (e.g. vine weevil larvae/pupae)
	- Ants
	- (Some) nematodes
+ Diseases
	- Root rot
	- Fungal infection
+ Not all small organisms are pests!
	- Earthworms
	- Springtails
	- Woodlice
	- Ladybirds
	- Mycorrhizal fungi
+ Management
	- Natural + focused: ladybirds, nematodes, predatory mites
	- Natural + broad-spectrum: neem oil or similar
	- Artificial: synthetic pesticides

### Heat
+ Significance
	- Plants evolved for specific climate
	- Indoor (Chinese) bonsai
		- Adapted for year-round warmth / tropical undergrowth
		- Common species: ficus (fig), chinese elm, tea tree, Buddhist pine
		- Year-round warmth
		- Dies if too cold
	- Outdoor (Japanese) bonsai
		- Adapted for cold winters
		- Common species: maple, juniper, <etc etc etc>
		- Dies of terminal confusion without a dormancy period
		- esp. wrt dormancy for outdoor, chills for indoor
+ Management
	- Keep indoor bonsai indoors
		- ... and don't leave them on a cold windowsill in January!
	- Ensure you have an outdoor space where you can leave bonsai for 2-3 months over winter
		- ... or, in extreme cases, a suitable cold-box or refrigerator!
	- If leaving ceramic pots outdoors in cold winters
+ Climate change shout-out
	- Some tree species may increasingly struggle to go dormant over winter
	- Especially true in cities such as London ("heat island effect")

### Light
+ Significance
	- There's this thing called "photosynthesis", y'know?
	- Quantity (lumens) vs colour (wavelength)
	- Too little: leaves die
	- Too much: leaves scorch
+ Management
	- Measurement options include expensive light measurement tools... or freebie phone apps!
	- Alternatively, ignore this unless your plants start losing leaves or dying
	- In mid-summer it may be necessary to move trees into shade or put up awnings
+ Climate change shout-out
	- Scorching in summer is becoming a huge problem
		- ... especially - but not only - for japanese maples

### Fertilising for health
+ Significance
	- Secondary macronutrients and micronutrients are needed in small quantities for both growth and day-to-day cell metabolism
	- Too little: leaves go funny colours, tree mysteriously dies
	- _Far_ too much: tree is poisoned
+ Secondary macronutrients: calcium, caesium, sulphur
+ Micronutrients: boron, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum, zinc, chlorine, nickel
+ Management
	- High-quality organic fertilisers: biogold etc
		- Pellets of organic matter (bonemeal etc)
		- Fermented first - stops rodents eating them!
	- Cheap commercial fertilisers: seaweed extracts etc
	- Plant tonics?

### Air circulation
+ Significance
	- There are these things called "oxygen", "carbon dioxide" and "dust"...
	- Too little: plant generally unhealthy
	- Too much: plant blows over or loses leaves
+ Is this a big deal?
	- My instructor reckons good air-flow is necessary for plant health
	- I'm not convinced it makes a difference for trees, except insofar as dust blocks photosynthesis and some pests dislike fresh air
	- Mosses _are_ heavily affected by air-flow - they use it to determine at what height to stop growing - but they don't usually need much of it to be happy
+ Management: windows, fans

## Bonsai development

### Cleaning & weeding
+ Significance
	- Dead leaves and twigs look unattractive and give pests hiding spots
	- Weeds contend for nutrients with the tree, and for space with moss
+ Common weeds
	- Pearlwort: mini-grass, sometimes confusingly called Irish Moss
	- Liverwort: flat green splodges
	- Oxalis (aka wood sorrel): three-leaved clover-like plant
	- Nostoc: small blobs of green gloop
	- Grass
+ Management
	- Remove dead leaves regularly, and dead twigs once you're _sure_ they're dead
	- Remove weeds when they get too obvious and/or when you re-pot, prune or wire
	- A lot of weeds can be used as "accent plants"... but not in the main bonsai pot!
	- Be aware that liverwort and nostoc can be signs of over-watering

### Fertilising for growth
+ Significance
	- Without macronutrient infusions, a bonsai will at best stay as-is... and at worst wither and die
		- ...Although deliberate starving may sometimes be used to encourage "desperation ploys" such as flower / fruit production and smaller leaves
	- Too much fertiliser can build up in the soil and stop roots absorbing water via osmosis
		- "Salt the earth" is an idiom for a reason!
+  Primary macronutrients 
	- Nitrogen: important for leaf and stem growth
	- Phosphorus (or P2O5 to be precise): important for flower / fruit and root growth
	- Potassium (or K2O): important for general tree health
	- Fertilisers are assessed by their "NPK values": N vs P2O5 vs K2O
+ Management
	- Bonsai practitioners typically use a "balanced" fertiliser: e.g. "5-5-5" or "7-7-7"
	- A lot of organic fertilisers are approximately balanced - good enough!
		- Seaweed extracts tend to be low on phosphorus.  Not a problem for lawn feeds etc, since it builds up in the soil over time... but we bonsai practitioners replace our soil every couple of years!
	- Cheap balanced liquid fertilisers readily available from stores
		- ...But don't forget micronutrients and secondary macronutrients (per "bonsai care" section)!
	- If fertilising heavily, keep an eye out for crystals forming on surface of soil

### (Re)potting & root pruning
+ Significance
	- Potting into a bonsai-size pot forces the tree to operate in a limited space, which promotes dwarfism
	- Regular re-potting (including back into the same pot!) gives us the opportunity to prune roots, check for pests, replace overly mushy soil, and generally clean up
	- Regular root pruning forces the creation of a strong root ball rather than unnecessary deep/wide roots
		- We don't _need_ tap-roots; we have wire!
		- We don't _need_ lateral roots (unless they look cool); we have watering cans!
		- We don't _want_ long roots; we have small pots!
	- Failing to re-pot regularly can lead to trees becoming pot-bound, affecting water retention (cos there's no soil left to retain it!)
	- Many trees can have most of their roots cut off and be fine
		- ...but with some exceptions: particularly yew.
+ Soil choice
	- Soil is serious business: many bonsai masters view their soil mixes as closely-guarded secrets!
	- Bonsai soil must:
		- physically support the tree - needs to be solid and sticky
		- allow the entry and exit of air and water - good drainage essential to avoid sliminess and drowned roots
		- retain enough water (inc. dissolved nutrients) to keep the root hairs alive
		- not have much nutrition - this will be provided separately!
		- not cost a complete fortune
	- Typical compost or UK garden soil won't cut it!
	- Options for structural component:
		- akadama-tsuchi ("red ball earth"): naturally-formed compacted clay pellets from Japan
		- moler clay... aka pink cat litter!
		- both these options also retain water via hydration rather than capillary action, which means less free water to drown roots
		- typical garden clay is _not_ useable as it blocks the pores in the aeration component
	- Options for aeration component
		- horticultural pumice
		- coir or shredded tree bark (but beware: this can provide extra nutrients as it decomposes, which may not be what you want)
		- biochar: high-quality charcoal (_not_ barbecue residue!)
	- Options for adding bulk cheaply
		- horticultural grit or river sand (_not_ builder's sand!)
		- small pebbles or gravel
		- beware using too much filler; it adds little benefit and obstructs more useful components
	- Options for ericaceous (acidity-loving) trees such as satsuki azalea
		- sphagnum: mixed in with the soil, this gradually acidifies as as it decomposes
		- kanuma-tsuchi (named after a city north of Tokyo): volcanic gravel 
	- A basic mix would be something like 2/3 akadama, 1/3 pumice
+ Management
	- Re-pot every one or two years
		- Two years is the traditional consensus, but my instructor reckons that re-potting every year is better for mature bonsai
		- Always re-pot if the tree has become pot-bound or if lots of roots are trying to escape out of the drainage holes

### Targeting growth via (branch) pruning
+ Significance
	- Pruning is what makes a bonsai look _right_:
		- Short inter-node distance
		- Ramification and fractal growth
		- Can promote smaller leaf growth
	- Stops the tree needing more water than the (small pot) roots can provide
		- Tree branch-to-root ratio has limits in both directions
	- Prevents growth in unwanted areas (e.g. above the apex) frees up resources for growth in desirable areas (e.g. trunk thickness)
	- Manages tree's shape / style
		- Often trying to recapitulate an imaginary natural history of the tree
		- Ideally, a bonsai is pruned (and wired - see next) to match the natural "habit" of a fully-grown tree
		- However, art is more important than authenticity; there's no point producing a scientifically-accurate but very boring tree!  For example: honeysuckle or wisteria bonsai are _not_ very thin strands...
	- Over-pruning can harm or even kill a tree
+ Management
	- The "rules" here are more like guidelines; ignore if they interfere with your goals for the tree!
	- Four broad groups:
		1. outdoor broad-leaved trees
		1. indoor broad-leaved trees
		1. coniferous trees with needle-like foliage (pine, spruce, yew)
		1. coniferous trees with scale-like foliage (cypress, juniper)
	- Outdoor broad-leaf
		1. In Spring, when shoots have grown past about 5 nodes, trim their tips
			- Prevents trees wasting effort on stuff you'll only cut off later
			- Exception is if you _want_ the tree to grow more in that direction (i.e. trunk or primary branch)
		1. In late Summer, when secondary budding ("Lammas growth") starts, prune back so that each branch has three growth areas for buds
			- This typically means three active - potentially bud-bearing - nodes for alternate-leaf species, or two active nodes (i.e. four possible buds, since we can't have half a node!) for opposite-leaf species
			- Encourages "inner growth" (i.e. stops tree getting lanky)
			- Third bud is "sacrificial": a spare shoot in case one of the others grows weakly or dies off
		1. When growth is slow but tree is not currently dormant, prune heavily if needed
			- "Structural" pruning reduces tree size or changes style
			- Where branches have more than two sub-branches coming off them, remove the weakest
			- Cut back branches that block a clear view of the trunk
			- Trim branches that stick out too far from the rest of the foliage, changing the tree's outline
		1. Remove unwanted growth as it appears, including:
			- excess shoots from "congested" nodes - i.e. those that already have enough branches/twigs coming out of them
			- unwanted "adventitious" shoots - i.e. those that appear randomly in the middle of a stretch of bark
			- suckers rising from roots
	- Indoor broad-leaf
		- Mostly per outdoor broad-leaf
		- Secondary budding isn't necessarily tied to the seasons; keep an eye on the tree's buds!
		- Growth doesn't necessarily slow down, so structural pruning is performed throughout the year
	- Needle conifers
		- Making sure your conifer survives pruning
			- In conifers, water is sucked up by pressure from the leaves/needles - without them, the tree dies of thirst!
			- Thus, never cut off too many leaves and branches at once
			- If cutting the trunk back, always make sure there is a strong branch below the cut
			- Note that some conifers (esp. yews) are also sensitive to cutting off too much root mass at once
		- Conifer branches are typically arranged into horizontal "pads", with clear gaps (negative space) between them
			- A pad should start a little way out from the trunk, so prune off any small branches or needles on the trunk and upper branch
			- Remove 
	- Scale conifers
		- Mostly per needle conifers
		- Unlike needles, individual scales can't be easily plucked off the tree.  However, since scales are very short, we don't have to be careful not to damage them
		- xxxx
	- Remember: Don't sweat the small stuff!
