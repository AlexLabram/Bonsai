## Meta - hide/remove before sharing

### Why this page
+ This is currently an outline of the theoretical content that will be presented during the workshop, and can act as presenter's notes for same.
+ In the longer term I'd like to break some of these sections out into separate MD files and rewrite them as prose rather than bullets, with the long-run goal of moving to R Bookdown or similar.

## Bonsai background

### Why we appreciate bonsai
+ Bonsai brings nature into unnatural environments
	- Home / office (for short periods or "indoor" species)
	- Formal garden
+ Bonsai has style
	- Japanese style: naturalistic
	- Chinese style: gargoyle
	- Western rube style: "I Can't Believe It's Not Bonsai" aka "Mall Bonsai" aka "Nonsai"
+ Bonsai has history
	- India: xxxx
	- Buddhism: xxxx
	- China: xxxx
	- Japan: xxxx
	- Bonsai diaspora: xxxx
	- Related arts: penjing, hon no bo, saikei
+ Bonsai has convenience
	- ...At least compared to a full tree / garden
	- xxxx Example: Alex's wall o' bonsai
+ Bonsai is educational and therapeutic
	- Improves awareness of what a tree needs to survive
	- Tactile and artistic elements
	- Become the god of a tiny world

### How we appreciate bonsai
+ Styles
	- Japanese styles: xxxx show pictures here
	- Chinese styles: xxxx show pictures here
	- Bunjingi: Japanese style based on imported Chinese ([Southern Song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_School)) woodcuts
	- Misc others e.g. Pierneef style
+ Qualities
	- Appearance of age
		- Ramification
		- "Nebari" (root flare - one of three japanese words you want to know)
		- Proportionality (where possible)
	- Spread
		- Focus
		- Dynamism
		- Negative space
	- Special features
		- Extreme size (either small or large)
		- Flowers / fruit
		- Integral deadwood / rocks
+ Misc fluff
	- Buddhist principles
	- General Japanese-ness
		- Minimalism: contra "I have made this longer than usual because I have not had time to make it shorter."
		- Appearance of austerity: "the art that conceals art"
		- Kodak moments, long before Kodak!

## Bonsai overview

### The bonsai lifecycle
+ xxxx Lifecycle diagram
+ Created from non-bonsai "material"
	- Choice of species
		- Outdoor (Japanese style) vs indoor (Chinese style)
			- Casual bonsai owners trying to keep an outdoor tree indoors is the single biggest killer of bonsai
		- Broadleaf vs conifer
		- xxxx Cladistic ~~tree~~ diagram
	- Sources
		- seeds (serious enthusiasts only!  Ignore "grow your own bonsai" kits)
		- cuttings from mature bonsai
		- non-bonsai seedlings/whips (esp. for "literati" styles)
		- non-bonsai mature trees
+ Kept alive for years / decades
	- Watering (!!!)
	- Pest control (!)
	- Heat
	- Light
	- Fertilising (micronutrients)
	- Air circulation (?)
+ Given treatment that lets them thrive (in the desired directions)
	- Cleaning & weeding
	- Fertilising (NPK)
	- Repotting - force a strong root ball rather than unnecessary deep/wide roots
	- Pruning - recapitulate the natural history of branch death
	- Wiring - recapitulate the natural history of branch strain / light-seeking
+ Occasional drastic action
	- Extreme Styling™
		- Trunk splitting
		- Grafting
		- Deadwood styling: jin (bare branch), shari (bare trunk), uro (cavity), sabamiki (split trunk)
	- Extreme Potting™
		- Root-over-rock style
		- Root-on-rock style
		- Moss ball ("kokedama")
		- Multiple tree styles
	- Extreme Propagating™
		- Layering
		- Air layering
		- Just cutting big chunks off an existing bonsai
	- Sticking the tree back in the ground to grow out
	- ...This section not discussed further here (we're focused on survive+thrive)
+ Prepping for display
	- Pot aesthetics
		- shape/finish/decoration
		- "masculine" vs "feminine"
	- Ornaments, accent plants and display rocks
	- Last-minute fixes: moss, small branch wiring
	- Stands & displays
	- Photography technique
	- ...This section not discussed further here (we're focused on survive+thrive)
+ End-of-life
	- Resale
		- Bonsai pricing gets very complicated!
		- Good record-keeping is important if you ever plan to sell on
	- Soil from dead plants can often be recycled if dried and sieved
	- ...This section not discussed further here (we're focused on survive+thrive)

### Doing it on the cheap
+ Easy ways to start bonsai:
	- Mature bonsai (i.e. large trunk relative to pot; good distinctive shape; has stopped trying too hard to grow)
	- Large numbers (nurseries)
	- Large pots (water control)
	- Lots of outside growing space, light/shade, etc
	- Good-quality specialist tools & materials (pots, soils, wire etc)
	- Experienced bonsai instructor
+ ...these all take £££ (or apprenticeship)
+ The alternative: YOLO / for science!
	- Cheap material: "urban yamadori", seeds/cuttings, knocked-down stock, rescued ICBINB
	- Improvised tools
	- Iterative: expect many to die; goal is to learn from mistakes
	- Training sources: Youtube, community, amateur instructors (!)
+ If your tree is healthy and attractive, how you got there is less important
	- Corollary: real bonsai practitioners know their way round power tools >:-D

## Bonsai care

+ Why is it so !"£$% difficult?
	- The practitioner is God... and this is the downside
	- Must provide everything that trees usually get from the environment / ecosystem

### Watering
+ Significance
	- Mis-watering is the second biggest killeer of bonsai
	- Under-watering: root hairs (microscopic) die off
	- Over-watering: root rot sets in (esp. when overcompensating for under-watering!)
	- Trad. bonsai soil drains well but is esp. prone to drying out completely
+ When to water
	- Back-of-hand test
	- Varies based on: bonsai/pot size; season (and location); species
+ Approaches:
	1. Dunking
		- Fill a bowl or basin with water
		- Place bonsai in water with water level slightly below the soil surface
		- Wait until surface is visibly wet before removing (may take longer or shorter depending on soil type, dryness, how long bonsai has been in pot)
		- Suitable for up to about 5 bonsai; any more and it starts to take forever
		- Water impurities tend to be driven upwards over time; water from the top occasionally to rinse them away
		- Solid fertiliser will just sit on the surface; use liquid feed instead
	1. "Bottle feeding"
		- Buy a small spray bottle and (empty) ketchup squeezy bottle and fill with water
		- Use spray bottle to wet the surface of the soil (or dried sphagnum) to break the surface tension
		- Gently squeeze water into the soil from close range; pause when the surface gets waterlogged; stop when water starts coming out the bottom
		- Suitable for up to about 10 bonsai
		- Appropriate for indoor bonsai where getting water everywhere is a bad thing
	1. Watering can
		- Buy a watering can with a slanted rose (e.g. Haws 700ml)
		- Water _three_ times per pot: once to break the surface tension, once to wet the upper soil, once to go right through; leave a short pause in between
		- Suitable for ~40-50 outdoor bonsai
		- Less suitable for indoor due to mess, and gets more time-consuming in hot weather (up to 1/2 hour per day!)
	1. Garden hose spray nozzle
		- Easiest approach for large bonsai collections, but requires more up-front effort

### Pest control
+ Significance
	- Pest infestations are the third biggest killer of bonsai
		- ...Also often the final nail in the coffin when keeping outdoor trees indoors
	- Many pests that would typically be taken care of by a tree's ecosystem (birds, other insects, etc) become far more dangerous for bonsai
+ Leaf pests
	- Aphids / greenfly
	- Spider mites
	- Leaf miners (fly larvae)
	- Weevils
+ Root pests
	- Grubs (e.g. vine weevil larvae/pupae)
	- Ants
	- (Some) nematodes
+ Not all wrigglies are pests!
	- Earthworms
	- Springtails
	- Woodlice
	- Ladybirds
+ Management
	- Natural + focused: ladybirds, nematodes, predatory mites
	- Natural + broad-spectrum: neem oil or similar
	- Artificial: synthetic pesticides

### Heat
+ Significance
	- Plants evolved for specific climate
	- Indoor (Chinese) bonsai
		- Adapted for year-round warmth / tropical undergrowth
		- Common species: ficus (fig), chinese elm, tea tree, Buddhist pine
		- Year-round warmth
		- Dies if too cold
	- Outdoor (Japanese) bonsai
		- Adapted for cold winters
		- Common species: maple, juniper, <etc etc etc>
		- Dies of terminal confusion without a dormancy period
		- esp. wrt dormancy for outdoor, chills for indoor
+ Management
	- Keep indoor bonsai indoors
		- ... and don't leave them on a cold windowsill in January!
	- Ensure you have an outdoor space where you can leave bonsai for 2-3 months over winter
		- ... or, in extreme cases, a suitable cold-box or refrigerator!
	- If leaving ceramic pots outdoors in cold winters
+ Climate change shout-out
	- Some tree species may increasingly struggle to go dormant over winter
	- Especially true in cities such as London ("heat island effect")

### Light
+ Significance
	- There's this thing called "photosynthesis", y'know?
	- Quantity (lumens) vs colour (wavelength)
	- Too little: leaves die
	- Too much: leaves scorch
+ Management
	- Measurement options include expensive light measurement tools... or freebie phone apps!
	- Alternatively, ignore this unless your plants start losing leaves or dying
	- In mid-summer it may be necessary to move trees into shade or put up awnings
+ Climate change shout-out
	- Scorching in summer is becoming a huge problem
		- ... especially - but not only - for japanese maples

### Fertilising for health
+ Significance
	- Micronutrients are needed for day-to-day plant metabolism
	- Too little: leaves go funny colours, tree mysteriously dies
	- Far too much: tree is poisoned
+ Management
	- High-quality organic fertilisers: biogold etc
		- Pellets of organic matter (bonemeal etc)
		- Fermented first - stops rodents eating them!
	- Cheap commercial fertilisers: seaweed juice etc
	- Plant tonics: xxxx can't really comment on these

### Air circulation
+ Significance
	- There are these things called "oxygen", "carbon dioxide" and "dust"...
	- Too little: plant generally unhealthy
	- Too much: plant blows over or loses leaves
+ Is this a big deal?
	- My instructor reckons good air-flow is necessary for plant health
	- I'm not convinced it makes a difference for trees, except insofar as some pests dislike fresh air
	- Mosses _are_ heavily affected by air-flow, but don't usually need much of it to be happy
+ Management: windows, fans

## Developing your bonsai

### Cleaning & weeding
+ Significance
	- Dead leaves and twigs look unattractive and give pests hiding spots
	- Weeds contend for nutrients with the tree, and for space with moss
+ Common weeds
	- Pearlwort: mini-grass, sometimes confusingly called Irish Moss
	- Liverwort: flat green splodges
	- Oxalis (aka wood sorrel): three-leaved clover-like plant
	- Nostoc: small blobs of green gloop
	- Grass
+ Management
	- Remove dead leaves regularly, and dead twigs once you're _sure_ they're dead
	- Remove weeds when they get too obvious and/or when you re-pot, prune or wire
	- A lot of weeds can be used as "accent plants"... but not in the main bonsai pot!
	- Be aware that liverwort and nostoc can be signs of over-watering

### Fertilising for growth
+ Significance
	- Without macronutrient infusions, a bonsai will at best stay as-is... and at worst wither and die
	- Too much fertiliser can build up in the soil and stop roots absorbing water via osmosis
		- "Salt the earth" is an idiom for a reason!
+  Macronutrients 
	- Nitrogen: important for leaf growth
	- Phosphorus (or P2O5 to be precise): important for root growth
	- Potassium (or K2O): important for flower and fruit growth
	- Fertilisers are assessed by their "NPK values": N vs P2O5 vs K2O
+ Management
	- Bonsai practitioners typically use a "balanced" fertiliser: e.g. "5-5-5" or "7-7-7"
	- A lot of organic fertilisers are approximately balanced - good enough!
	- Cheap balanced liquid fertilisers readily available from stores
	- If fertilising heavily, keep an eye out for crystals forming on surface of soil

### Repotting (including root pruning)
+ Significance
	- Root pruning forces the creation of a strong root ball rather than unnecessary deep/wide roots
		- We don't need tap-roots; we have wire!
		- We don't need lateral roots (unless they look cool); we have watering cans!
		- We don't want long roots; we have small pots!
	- Failing to re-pot regularly can lead to trees becoming pot-bound, affecting water retention (cos there's no soil left to retain it!)
+ Soil choice xxxx
+ Management
	- Re-pot every one or two years
		- Two years is the traditional consensus, but my instructor reckons that re-potting every year is better for mature bonsai
		- Always re-pot if the tree has become pot-bound or if lots of roots are trying to escape out of the drainage holes

### Branch pruning
+ Significance
	- Pruning is what makes a bonsai look _right_
	- Short inter-node distance
	- Ramification and fractal growth
	- Can promote smaller leaf growth
	- Stops the tree needing more water than the (small pot) roots can provide
		- Tree branch-to-root ratio
	- Shape / style
		- Often trying to recapitulate an imaginary natural history of the tree
+ Management
	- Broad-leaved trees
		1. When shoots grow past about 5 nodes, trim tips
			- Prevents trees wasting effort on stuff you'll only cut off later
			- Exception is if you _want_ the tree to grow more in that direction (i.e. trunk or primary branch)
		1. When secondary budding ("Lammas growth") starts, prune back to 3 active (buddable) nodes for alternate-leaf species, or 2 active nodes for opposite-leaf species 
			- Encourages "inner growth" (i.e. stops tree getting lanky)
			- Third node is "sacrificial": intended to be removed at a later date
		1. When growth is slow, but tree is not currently dormant, prune heavily if needed
			- "Structural" pruning reduces tree size or changes formal style
		1. Remove unwanted growth as it appears, including:
			- excess shoots from "congested" nodes - i.e. those that already have enough growth
			- unwanted "adventitious" shoots - i.e. those that appear randomly in the middle of a stretch of bark
			- suckers rising from roots
	- Conifers
		- Making sure your conifer survives pruning
			- In conifers, water is sucked up by pressure from the leaves/needles - without them, the tree dies of thirst!
			- Thus, never cut off too many leaves and branches at once
			- If cutting the trunk back, always make sure there is a strong branch below the cut
			- Note that some conifers (esp. yews) are also sensitive to cutting off too much root mass at once
		- Conifer branches are typically arranged into horizontal "pads", with clear gaps (negative space) between them
			- A pad should start a little way out from the trunk, so prune off any small branches or leaves right next to it
			- 
		- xxxx still 
	- Remember: Don't sweat the small stuff!
+ Timetable for outdoor deciduous trees
	- Tip-trimming: early in year (optional)
	- Lammas pruning: some time in summer
	- Structural pruning: start or end of year
+ Timetable for indoor trees: there is no timetable, it's all as-needed!
