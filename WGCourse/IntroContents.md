# Bonsai on a Budget: Course Summary

<details>

## Meta - hide/remove before sharing

### Why this page
I'd like to keep this separate:
a. to make it easy to print before the session, and
a. to allow me to tweak the timings without affecting content-related files

### To do
+ Is there any way to make columns hideable?
	- If so: apply it to the "notes status" column, and add a "target start time" column
+ Add numbering?
+ Add indents for sub-sections?  Is this possible in github md?
+ Remove "notes status" section once all sections are in good shape
