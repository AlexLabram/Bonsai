# On Urban Yamadori

## Background

"Yamadori" (山採り - literally: "mountain-gathered") refers to what are also called "natural bonsai": trees which, although untouched by human hand, exhibit traits seen in cultivated Japanese-style bonsai.  Basically, they look like scaled-down versions of their full-grown siblings.

Yamadori mostly appear in marginal environments, such as rocky mountain-sides, where any attempt to grow to full size is met with disaster either due to exhausting the available nutrition, losing limbs and leaves to strong winds, or taking in too many environmental toxins.  The first Karate Kid film famously displays a yamadori that grew on a sea-facing cliff: a sparse, salty, blustery environment almost tailor-made to produce a very tiny tree.

I have neither the time nor the energy to go looking for yamadori in the UK, and I would be too concerned about the ethical implications of collecting them anyway.  However, to city-dwellers like me, there is a ready source of tiny trees the collection of which has no ethical issues whatsoever.  And, whilst they may not be 100% legal to collect, there is essentially zero chance of anyone complaining.

I am referring to rogue (weed) trees found in council flowerbeds.  These shouldn't even exist: any responsible council contractor would actively remove them.  However, there are a large number of *irresponsible* contractors who, when presented with a large tree in an inappropriate location, will simply cut it back to ground level and move on.  When the tree inevitably re-grows the following year, they'll cut it back again... and again... until you're eventually left with a very strong tree with very small aspect.  I refer to these trees as "urban yamadori".

## Is the collection of urban yamadori legal?

Technically: no, or at least not without permission from the council in question.

(This permission would usually be impossible to acquire unless you actually bump into a gardener in action, since the list of council employees who are able to give permission and the list who are willing to spend time on trivialities like this are generally non-overlapping.)

From the [Lancashire Police site](https://www.lancashire.police.uk/faqs/wildlife-crime/what-are-the-laws-that-protect-wild-plants/):

> Under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, it is unlawful to uproot any wild plant without permission from the landowner or occupier. To uproot (digging) a plant means to 'dig up or otherwise remove the plant from the land on which it is growing', whether or not it actually has roots.

However, it's worth noting that other activities such as guerilla gardening are also illegal on paper.  As someone who has been happily gardening the flowerbed outside my flat for the last year, I have accepted the associated slight legal risk.

A related - but not entirely identical - question is whether it would actually be possible to be prosecuted for removing an urban yamadori.  I have serious trouble seeing this happening.  The worst outcome that I can plausibly envisage is receiving a Fixed Penalty Notice for environmental crime (typically on the order of £100) and electing not to challenge it.

## Is the collection of urban yamadori moral / ethical

Justice must be done (morality) and justice must be seen to be done (ethics).

In principle, I believe that it is moral to collect urban yamadori.  These are trees that, by definition, aren't supposed to be there and will be removed as soon as a responsible contractor takes over the area.

Arguably this is more moral than producing bonsai from typical cultivated material.  I've had a few people ask whether it's cruel to the tree to force it into a bonsai style; whilst I think the answer is a firm "no", the fact that UY uses material that would otherwise have been weeded means it is very obviously in the tree's best interests!

The ethics question is slightly trickier: how do you signal to people that you're not just an environmental vandal?  This webpage is one part of my answer to that question: by having a public description of how I operate, I can make clear that I'm making my selection based on principle rather than greed.  No-one needs to fear that I'll randomly remove an attractive plant from their flowerbed.

## Principles for collection of urban yamadori

### Identifying appropriate UY locations

xxxx not wild, not purely private (or with permission), not well-tended (or with permission - 14(?) Kittiwake, Ethelred group)

### Identifying appropriate UY candidates

A good potential urban yamadori is:
1. A rogue tree (I don't like the term "weed" in this context)
1. *Very visibly* a rogue tree
1. Capable of being removed without major damage to itself
1. Capable of being removed without any observable damage to the surroundings

See below for rogue tree identification criteria.

### Removing UY

1. Commit to finishing if you start (xxxx big ToH)
1. Don't do any observable damage to the surroundings
1. Clear up after yourself

I have also gotten into the habit of planting a cheap-but-attractive flower wherever I have removed an entrenched UY example (i.e. not just a random seedling).  It's probably unnecessary but I find it reassuring to leave the area visibly better than I found it.

## Identifying rogue trees

There is no 100% certain way to ensure that a given tree really is rogue without asking the property owner.  Maybe that council property's manager just happens to be a huge tree-of-heaven fan, and really liked the effect created by a seedling growing out of the wall by their rubbish bins?  Ludicrous but technically possible.

However, a rough bayesian assessment can be made.  I have found the following criteria relevant for determining whether a given tree can be considered rogue or not.  If anyone has further suggestions, please get in touch. 

xxxx unattractive given surroundings; potentially damaging to surroundings; species commonly found wild (either in the area or because there's a big example nearby spitting out seedlings); species infrequently found in cultivation; tree shows signs of repeated brush cutting
