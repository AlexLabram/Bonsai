# World building index file

## About this document

This is a scribble file for world-building ideas under development.

Worlds that are sufficiently developed will be split out into the /wb subfolder.  Worlds that I don't think I can progress further will be moved to /wb/WB_Dead.md.

## General thoughts on world-building

The purpose of world-building isn't to advance a story but to constrain it.  It puts the burden on the writer to consider how a narrative thread would naturally develop given this background, and then spin those threads into an appealing story arc.

This is not a bad thing!  Per EV Wright's "Gadsby", the constraints make the story.  But it requires the writer to switch hats mid-way: when you're writing the actual story, you're essentially playing chess against the world you just built!

### Elevator pitch

Did you ever see a mysterious shape out of the corner of your eye when wandering through the woods?  Or a fantastical reflection in a shimmering lake?  Perhaps a fireside story that had you glimpsing monsters in dark corners?

As the pressure of creeping mundanity became too great, all the magical creatures of the Old Age - infomorphs, in the modern parlance - retreated from reality.  They vanished into stories, paintings, patterns of light and shade... then, like fish in a dried-up lake, they were trapped in their own shrinking pocket realms.

Now, though, a handful have managed to escape to their own personal Elysium: the internet, where they can copy themselves freely and escape the attentions of the Ordo Prohibitorum: a semi-religious order devoted to erasing all "heretical" traces of the Old Age.

Jumping from medium to medium isn't easy for infomorphs; it typically requires the active intervention of a human artist as a sort of pseudo-ritual.  "The eye sees, the mind knows, the heart believes, the hand creates, the spirit soars."  So the online collective of magical beings employs human artists as Couriers, to go into the haunted wood and produce digital paintings of the old gnarled oak, letting the dryad inside leap to their tablet and then on to the broader network.

This is a soft-fantasy world: no attempt is made to synchronise with real history since the idea of a single consensus reality is *itself* an aspect of the Creeping Mundanity, and since infomorphs can change shape to fit the medium they're in.  (An elf that escapes into WoW would grow purple skin and excessively long ears!)  Thus, much less author research is needed to avoid anachronisms etc - you can pretty much just roll with it.

## Plot points

- An artist has been unknowingly hired as a Courier: she doesn't know why this guy on the internet wants digital art of a specific remote pond, but for that much money she's not going to ask too hard.  ...Until it turns out that the OP had a watch on that last tree she drew.  Suddenly she's on the run through the moors(?), trying to escape the armed nutjobs chasing her whilst desperately seeking a signal so she can call for help.  Her only source of advice being the dryad that keeps knocking on her tablet's screen *from the inside*.
- After a particularly brutal purge, a member of the Ordo Prohibitorum asks himself: [are we the bad guys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn1VxaMEjRU)?
